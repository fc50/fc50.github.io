00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
From geodetic coordinates, the first thing you usually want to

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.300
do is convert to a linearized Cartesian coordinate frame,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.640
the so-called Earth-centered Earth-fixed or ECEF frame.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.380
The key idea with the ECEF frame is that every point in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.060
space is represented as x, y, and z.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.500
What is really most useful is a coordinate system that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.855
actually has its origin somewhere on the surface of the earth.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.769
That could be your takeoff point

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.030
or maybe it's home-based or some other convenient location.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.605
In this frame, the z coordinate is the height above the surface of the earth

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:37.324
while x and y basically tell you how far you are laterally from the origin of the frame.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.470
And with that, you have a local ECEF frame.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.390
So, next comes the choice of how to represent

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.649
this frame with respect to the geodetic frame.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.198
The x and y axes now define a plane that's

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:49.829
tangent to the surface of the earth, and in principle,

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.795
I could choose to have those axes point at any direction where

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.359
the most common representation using aeronautics

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.829
is having x point north, then y point east.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.640
Wait a second, that's not east, that's east.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.750
That means, z has to point down.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.060
It might seem counter-intuitive to have z point

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.995
down instead of up to indicate altitude above the earth,

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.355
but in this case, that would leave you with

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:15.125
a left-handed coordinate system which is not standard for aeronautics.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.480
So instead, we let z be positive downward and we have

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.890
the so-called North East Down or NED coordinate frame.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.849
This is the most common local frame used in aeronautics and is what

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.069
we'll be using as our local ECEF frame throughout this program.
