00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Up to this point, you've been considering how you can find

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.379
a path from a start state to a goal state by connecting cells in a grid.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.984
In the real world, however,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.369
you need to take into account the fact that your vehicle has

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.535
physical size that occupies space in the world,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.280
and not only that, it has an orientation which for

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.475
some kinds of vehicles can limit how and where it can move.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.145
A big part of solving the planning problem is finding a way to represent the vehicle.

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.414
And for different kinds of representations,

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:29.894
particular algorithms can operate more or less efficiently.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:31.980
So in this lesson, we'll take a look at how to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.765
represent your vehicle's position and orientation within the world.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:37.244
And then, how to incorporate

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:41.509
that information into your search space for solving the planning problem.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.034
We'll start out by investigating

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:45.179
three different coordinate frames that come in

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.850
handy for representing your vehicle's position,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.844
namely: the geodetic or global frame,

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:53.100
your local Cartesian coordinate frame,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.240
and the body frame which is a coordinate frame attached to the vehicle itself.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.579
After that, I'll show you how you can express

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.070
your vehicle's orientation using Euler angles and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.530
rotation matrices and how life gets

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.650
so much simpler when you switch to using quaternions. What are those?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.030
We'll find out. We'll combine these representations of position and orientation to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.129
describe the motion through the physical world

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.189
as transformations of position and orientation.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.599
And finally, we'll explore

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.140
the so-called configuration space of your planning problem which is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.000
the parameter space where you incorporate

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.250
your vehicle's physical size and shape into your description of the environment.
