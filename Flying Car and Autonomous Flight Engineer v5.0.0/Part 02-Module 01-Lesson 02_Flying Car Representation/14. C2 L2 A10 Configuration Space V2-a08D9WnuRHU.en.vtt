00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
At this point, we've covered some really useful ideas

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:07.130
when it comes to representing your vehicle for solving the planning problem.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.500
We've looked at different coordinate frames and how you can represent

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.355
your vehicles position and orientation within those coordinate frames.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.040
But real robots are not just points and orientation vectors,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.650
they have some physical size.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.180
And the real world is not

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.280
just some big empty coordinate frame, but it has obstacles in it.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.270
So, now I'm going to talk about how to represent

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.415
your vehicle within what is called your configuration space,

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.290
which is a way of taking into account the physical size of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.525
the vehicle as well as the location of obstacles in the environment.

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.310
Let's start with a simple example where I've got

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.510
this square-shaped robot that is free to move about in a 2D plane.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
I can then also introduce an obstacle into the environment like this.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
This obstacle now represents locations where the robot cannot go.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.930
So, we refer to those points as infeasible locations for the robot.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.478
So, now I have a robot with a physical size and the world has obstacles.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.790
But for computational purposes,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.180
I would still like to represent my vehicle or,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.960
in this case, my little square robot as simply a point in an orientation vector.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
So, suppose I choose this point as the origin in the body frame of my robot.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.173
I'd now like to know what regions of space are feasible and infeasible for that point.

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.420
To see how that works, I can simply move the robot around

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.535
the obstacle and see what kind of shape is mapped out.

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:30.215
Okay, so now the set of infeasible points for our chosen origin point looks like this.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.775
I didn't have to choose that particular origin point.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.575
I could have chosen any point in the body frame of the vehicle.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.490
And for each different point,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.835
the infeasible area would take on a slightly different shape.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.340
So, what about orientation?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.710
Well, I can change the orientation of my robot and see that it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.273
traces out a new area of infeasible locations.

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:51.785
And as I continue to change the orientation,

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:56.755
each new orientation traces out a new area of infeasible points in space.

00:01:56.755 --> 00:02:00.680
In this way, I can map out what the infeasible area looks like for

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.410
my chosen point of origin in the body frame at all possible orientations of the vehicle.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.455
This new map of the environment is three-dimensional and is referred to

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:13.660
as my configuration space with free points and infeasible points.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.590
In general, your configuration space will have

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.015
a dimensionality equal to the number of degrees of freedom of your robot.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.390
So, in this case, our robot has

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.735
two translational degrees of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:25.325
So, three total.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.630
Flying robots typically have six degrees of freedom,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.597
three translational and three rotational.

00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:35.290
Your configuration space for a flying car will be six-dimensional.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.370
The most exciting and useful thing about configuration space is that within this space,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.415
your robot becomes a single point.

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:44.795
Obstacles take on more complex shapes.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:45.980
So, for example, on the case,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.690
we just looked at my 2D obstacle now takes on a three-dimensional shape because it

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.484
looks different to the robot as a function of the robot's orientation.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.145
Even though the obstacles have more complex shapes now,

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.820
it's much easier to plan a path because we can represent the robot

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.360
as a single point in this three-dimensional space.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.905
To consider one more example,

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:10.445
we can look at a different 2D robot and multiple obstacles.

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.310
In 2D space, you might think of the robot as

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.245
sweeping out some area as it travels through the environment,

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:18.005
but in configuration space,

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:22.805
the robot moves through three-dimensional obstacles as a single point.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.599
Going into higher dimensional configuration spaces,

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.793
it gets harder to visualize things,

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:29.985
but that's not a problem because in fact,

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:34.745
we're not actually going to compute these complex obstacle shapes explicitly.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:35.810
And rather than defining

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.455
a six-dimensional configuration space for your quadrotor and simulation,

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:43.700
you'll create a simplified 3D configuration space by simply adding

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.000
a margin of infeasible space around each of the physical obstacles before planning.
