00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
In this lesson, I've covered the basics of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.330
vehicle representation which is a key concept in robotics applications of all kinds.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.474
But in particular, for flying cars,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.289
where you'll need to plan a path from

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.375
one place to another while avoiding obstacles along the way.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.480
We started out by looking at

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.625
the coordinate systems that you'll be dealing with in this program.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:20.579
These include the geodetic frame,

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.139
which is a spherical latitude and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.399
longitude frame covering the entire surface of the earth.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.684
Then, your local Earth-Center Earth-Fixed or ECEF frame,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:31.919
which is a more convenient Cartesian frame for

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.289
representimg motion within your local environment.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.149
And finally, the body frame,

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.365
which allows you to define where things are

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.640
with respect to one another on the body of your vehicle.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.700
Next, we looked at vehicle orientations and how you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.015
can describe changes in orientation using Euler angles,

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.664
and rotation matrices, or quaternions.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:54.450
In this program, you'll be converting back and forth between Euler angles and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.859
quaternions to take advantage of the mathematical simplicity of quaternions,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.575
and the intuitive nature of Euler angles.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.260
With position and orientation defined,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.660
we looked at how you can describe the motion of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.409
your vehicle using transformations of position and orientation.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.799
And finally, we explored how

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
the physical shape of your vehicle can be taken into consideration to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.920
define a configuration space which is the parameter space

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.000
that allows you to treat your vehicle as a simple point.
