00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
As I said before, Euler angles are intuitive,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.129
but they suffer from a problem known as gimbal lock.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.919
So, first off, what the heck is a gimbal anyway?

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.679
Well, gimbal is just a support with a pivot point

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.849
that allows an object to be rotated about one axis.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.710
To allow more degrees of freedom, we can add more gimbals.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
To be able to rotate about three axes and simulate the behavior of Euler angle rotations,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.150
we'll need three gimbals, like this.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.399
So, for Euler rotations,

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.033
you can imagine your vehicle attached to these gimbals,

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.589
and you send it commands to roll,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.570
pitch, and yaw about the axes in the gimbals.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.420
What you'll notice very quickly in this configuration is that order matters.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.255
To demonstrate gimbal lock in this configuration,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.760
I can see that if I start a series of

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:47.954
rotations by first pitching the vehicle up to 90 degrees,

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:51.780
then what will happen is that the red and blue gimbals will line up.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.776
Suddenly roll and yaw actually have the same effect.

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:58.290
What that means is that the vehicle can no longer yaw.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.045
Or rather, it will be as if a yaw maneuver actually affects the roll of the vehicle.

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:05.894
This was a real problem for the Apollo astronauts.

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:10.465
They were using a mechanical set of gimbals to compute the attitude of their vehicle,

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.405
and they needed the flight computer to warn them if they were close to gimbal lock,

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:18.859
and they would have to be careful to steer the ship away from falling into gimbal lock,

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.825
if they wanted to know which way was up.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.570
This was so annoying that Michael Collins asked

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.299
mission control for an extra gimbal for Christmas.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.629
A redundant fourth gimbal makes gimbal lock go away.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.344
Why didn't the Apollo units have a fourth gimbal?

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:35.569
Well, it seems that at MIT we didn't think

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.049
the weight and cost is worth it. Sorry about that Mike.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.109
So, does this mean the vehicle can't physically yaw?

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.579
Well, if it were bolted to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.549
a gimbal apparatus like this that's exactly what it would mean.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.179
But of course our vehicle is not bolted down and is free to physically yaw,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.287
but by describing orientation through the use of Euler angles,

00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:57.080
we've effectively bolted it down with mathematics

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.295
because the order of rotations can cause exactly the same effect.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:05.390
So, gimbal lock is both a mathematical property of using Euler angles to

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.421
represent the vehicle's attitude and is a physical property of real gimbals.

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.633
If you have a device that stabilized using three separate mechanical gimbals,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.429
the ordering of how they are arranged matters,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.740
just like the order in which you apply Euler rotations matters.
