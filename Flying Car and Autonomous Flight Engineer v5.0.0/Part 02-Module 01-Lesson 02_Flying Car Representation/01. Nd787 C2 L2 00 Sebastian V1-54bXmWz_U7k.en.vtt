00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
Okay. Today my job is to make you think like a drone.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.039
You might think a drone moves in a three-dimensional space x,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.905
y, and z, and that is correct.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.470
But on top of it, there's more state variables,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.040
they're called rotation angles.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.480
There is pitch, there's row,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.400
and the third one is yaw,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.100
where the drone rotates on its own center.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.955
These three rotation angles are the subject of what we're going to do next.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:29.429
We're going to look into all angles,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.300
rotation matrices, and something completely crazy,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.570
something called quaternions. Have fun.
