00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
In our investigation of the planning problems so far,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.519
we've talked about the fact that different choices of

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.309
representation can make the problem easier or harder to solve.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.885
In this context, one of the most basic questions to consider is,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.625
how do you represent the vehicle?

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.780
The way that you represent location in the world is typically using a coordinate frame.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.850
For flying cars, we're actually going to have

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.515
to keep track of a few different coordinate frames.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.199
The first frame you're going to have to keep track

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.390
of is the one that you're probably most familiar

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
with which is latitude and longitude for specifying a location on the earth.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.785
This will be a lot easier to explain if I actually had a globe

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.029
to show you. Thanks, globe fairy.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.605
Latitude and longitude on the globe,

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:43.504
they define what's known as the geodetic frame.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.500
Of course, for flying cars,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.710
we need to keep track of altitude as well.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.140
The geodetic frame is just a spherical coordinate system where

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.774
the typical coordinates are theta and phi are represented by altitude,

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:58.159
longitude, and latitude respectively.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.019
Altitude, of course, is your height above the earth's surface.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.540
And so unlike a typical spherical coordinate system with r equals to zero at the origin,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.690
we set altitude to be zero at the surface of the earth.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.840
Latitude and longitude then specify

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.049
your position on that spherical surface and they can be given in degrees,

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.929
minutes, seconds, or degrees decimals.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.130
So, its important to know the units you're working with.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:23.030
It's also important to know the order in which you're being given latitude and longitude.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.420
A spherical coordinate system can be a little bit difficult for actually doing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.484
motion planning because it's hard to compute distances using angular quantities.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:33.170
So next, we'll convert to a more convenient local frame.
