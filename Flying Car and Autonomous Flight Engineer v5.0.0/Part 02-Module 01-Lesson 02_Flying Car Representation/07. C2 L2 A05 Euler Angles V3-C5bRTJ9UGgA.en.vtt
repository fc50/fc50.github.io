00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
The most common representation for

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.979
three dimensional orientation is through what are called Euler angles,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.925
named after the famous 18th century mathematician Leonhard Euler.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:14.540
Euler angles are usually given as roll, pitch, and yaw.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.449
And they specify the attitude or orientation of a vehicle,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.500
or any other rigid body for that matter,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.612
as a sequence of rotations about the axes of the body-frame coordinate system.

00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:29.414
So, here I have a vehicle and my body-frame coordinate system looks like this,

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:31.769
with positive x toward the front of the vehicle,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.744
positive y out the right hand side,

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:35.829
and positive z pointing down.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.070
In the body frame, you can think of roll as

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.905
the counterclockwise rotation about the positive x-axis.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:44.160
So I tell you that the vehicle rolled positive 30 degrees.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.669
I mean that looking down from above the positive x direction,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.090
this maneuver appears as a counterclockwise rotation of the vehicle.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.400
Also, it's really important that we all agree that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.109
rotations are always counterclockwise around the axis.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.439
You can think of this as a right handed rule.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.484
If your right handed thumb points along the axis of rotation,

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.069
positive rotations are in the directions that your fingers curl.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.039
The same convention applies for the other two Euler angles.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.430
Namely, pitch is defined as a counterclockwise rotation about

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.905
the positive y-axis and yaw as a counterclockwise rotation about the positive z-axis,

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:19.769
keeping in mind that the z-axis points down.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.099
Notice that the body frame resembles our ECEF local frame,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:24.599
where x points north,

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.584
y to the east, and z down. And that's no mistake.

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:31.119
With this choice of body frame when the vehicle is level and pointing north,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.320
the axes of the body frame are aligned with the local north, east,

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.114
down ECEF frame and yaw angles correspond to heading angles on a compass.

00:01:39.114 --> 00:01:43.449
This convention derives from way back when ships were first sailing on the oceans.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.359
We didn't have to do things this way,

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.659
but generally it makes things more intuitive and these are

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.884
the most common choice of local and body-frame coordinate systems for aeronautics.

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.225
There is no common standard for the orders specifying Euler angles.

00:01:57.224 --> 00:01:59.429
Whether it's roll first then pitch then yaw,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.490
or pitch then yaw then roll.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.479
You just have to agree on the ordering with

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.685
everybody you're developing your software with.

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:09.884
And stick to it, because when I give you a triplet of numbers,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:14.484
it doesn't uniquely specify the orientation unless you already know the order of things.

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:17.150
This is actually a source of many real world bugs in robotics,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.604
so watch out for this.

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:21.585
In this program, we'll go with a convention of roll first,

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:24.200
then pitch, then yaw, in that order.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.444
Euler angles are easy to understand,

00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:27.870
but they have some problems.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990
One of which is, as I just said,

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.064
that the order which the rotations are applied matters.

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:35.099
So, if I'm going to say that the vehicle is

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.335
rolled and pitched to get some new orientation,

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.780
I need to know whether the roll is applied first,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.310
and then the pitch, or the other way around.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.520
Again, it's a matter of convention.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.695
But, if you get the convention wrong,

00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:49.454
then the orientation you calculate will also be wrong.

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:52.650
But that's not all. There's also the problem of gimbal lock,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.090
which is what we'll look at next.
