00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
There are a couple of more key ideas that we need to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.869
consider about the vehicle representation in order to get to planning.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.390
You now know that you can represent the location of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.015
your vehicle as a reference point in some coordinate frame.

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:17.640
For the most part, we'll be considering the local ECEF frame for planning and you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.824
can represent your vehicles orientation in that local ECEF frame as a reference vector.

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:26.259
So, you have your vehicle in a local ECEF coordinate frame,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.820
it's got some reference location point, it's got some orientation.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.365
And next, you can think about actual motion of the vehicle

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:38.010
as basically just changes to the reference point in your coordinate system.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.719
So for instance, if the vehicle is at

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.789
some location 'x' sub 'b' and is going to move to some new location,

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.789
let's call it 'x' sub 'b' prime then we can think of the new location of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.924
the vehicle is equal to the previous location plus this transformation vector.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.809
If you want your vehicle to not only translate to a new location,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.870
but also to rotate to some new orientation then

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.244
you'll construct a corresponding quaternion 'q' sub theta

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.890
and you can now think of your new orientation as equal to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.385
'q' sub theta times the original orientation times 'q' sub theta prime.

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.094
And so it's as simple as that.

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:11.489
Every time your vehicle goes through

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:14.834
a transformation of position and orientation during planning,

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.009
you're just applying a translation to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.844
the reference points and a rotation to the reference orientation.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:25.000
You can sequence these changes together over time to create a plan.
