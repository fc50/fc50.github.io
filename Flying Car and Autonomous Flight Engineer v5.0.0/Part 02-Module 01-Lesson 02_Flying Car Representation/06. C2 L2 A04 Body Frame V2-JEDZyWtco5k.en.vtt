00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
One last coordinate frame that we're going to keep track of is the body frame.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.575
The origin of the body frame is going to be some point on the vehicle.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:08.955
Could be for example,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.940
the center of mass, or it could be some other location.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.040
All of the other points in the body frame are defined relative to that origin.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.710
If the vehicle moves,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.870
the body frame moves with it.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.550
There are two main reasons we need a body frame.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.840
One is that the body frame is a really useful and convenient way of keeping track of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.385
the relative distances between different elements of the vehicle like the sensors.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.280
So, I might have a camera on the front of the vehicle,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.020
I might have an IMU at the tail,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.735
I might have air sensors on the wings and so on.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.540
Knowing where all of these sensors are relative to one

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.270
another in the body frame is very important

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.625
for fusing all the sensor measurements together

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:48.045
into a consistent estimate of where the vehicle is.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:52.020
The second reason the body frame is important is that this is often

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.360
the best coordinate frame for representing

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.675
control inputs such as velocities and accelerations.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:00.510
For example, for a fixed-wing vehicle,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.870
it's easiest to think of the throttle just changing the magnitude of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.440
the thrust vector that is fixed along the x axis in the body frame.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.220
As the vehicle is moving and rotating that thrust vector changes,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.165
which way it points in the external world,

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.710
but it's going to stay constant in the body frame.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.280
It's a lot harder to think of the throttle as a three-dimensional control input.
