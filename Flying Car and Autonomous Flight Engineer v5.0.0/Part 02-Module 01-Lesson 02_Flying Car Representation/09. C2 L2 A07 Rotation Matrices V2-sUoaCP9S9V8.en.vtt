00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.974
Now, let's take a closer look at the mathematical gimbal lock property of Euler angles.

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:06.269
Given a coordinate system,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.859
I can represent the orientation of some point in space by an actual rotation matrix.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.714
So, I have my vehicle which is at some location in a particular frame,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.905
let's say it's the local ECF frame,

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.740
and I can represent the orientation of the vehicle as

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.070
corresponding to a rotation in that frame driven by rotation matrix.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.429
Here are the three different rotation matrices

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.554
corresponding to a roll rotation about the x-axis,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.920
a pitch rotation about the y-axis,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
and yaw rotation about the z-axis.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.090
With these matrices, I can represent any attitude of the vehicle as a sequence of roll,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.045
pitch, and yaw rotations.

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.675
And to move the vehicle to a new orientation,

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:47.634
I then multiply these matrices together to get my new representation.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:51.250
The order in which I apply these rotations matters, as we said a few times.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.000
Then under certain conditions, I'll run into gimbal lock.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.920
But another concern is that this is now

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.140
an over parameterized system ready to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.215
carry around nine numbers in order to represent my orientation,

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.954
which does have some modest storage implications.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:07.469
Despite these drawbacks, Euler angles are still used in

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.400
many aeronautics applications because they are intuitive and useful,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.690
for example, in communication with a human pilot.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.280
In this program, to run your calculations,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.920
you'll be converting your Euler angles into quaternions,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.305
which are a much more elegant representation

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:25.000
that will simplify your life and your computation.
