        "description": "## The Goal of this Project ##\n\nIn the real world the flight controller is usually implemented in C or C++. So in this project you will implement your controller in C++. The code you write here can eventually be transferred to a real drone!\n\n## Project Steps ##\n\nThis project originally had two parts. In the first part we asked students to implement a controller in Python. We've since removed that portion of the project, but you may find the [solution implementation](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls/blob/solution/controller.py) helpful to consult as a reference. \n\n1. Make sure you have cloned the repository and gotten familiar with the C++ environment as outlined in **C++ Setup**.\n\n2. Complete each of the scenarios outlined in the [C++ project readme](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP). This will involve implementing and tuning controllers incrementally:\n\n - Body rate and roll/pitch control (scenario 2) \n - Position/velocity and yaw angle control (scenario 3) \n - Non-idealities and robustness (scenario 4) \n\n3. Tune your controller and make sure it works to successfully meet each of the evaluations in each scenario.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on the individual steps, make sure to read through the [C++ project readme](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP), specifically the [section outlining the tasks for the project](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP#the-tasks).\n\n## Evaluation ##\n\nFor the submission, you will be evaluated on your completion of the five control functions, the motor command functions, and on your controller's performance in each scenario.  Performance metrics are provided for each of the different scenarios, and your controller will need to meet these minimum performance metrics for each scenario.  For the specific metrics for each scenario look at the [evaluation portion of the C++ readme](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP#evaluation).\n\n## Submission ##\n\nFor this project you will need to submit:\n\n 1. `QuadController.cpp` and `QuadControlParams.txt`, containing your completed C++ controller and associated gains.\n 2.  A writeup addressing all the points of the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1643/view)\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease fill out the [Control of a 3D Quadrotor Feedback Form](https://goo.gl/forms/Zy6HjhlTvIOVgkjJ3) after you have completed the project. \n\n## Share Your Project\nHave something fun to share? Controller not listening and teetering away? Or maybe its going above and beyond with synchronized dancing? We love to see any and all of your creations!\n\nWhat you’ve accomplished is no small feat. Give yourself a pat on the back and some well-deserved recognition by sharing your amazing project with your network.\n\nCreate a gif or youtube video of your project implementation in the simulator and share with us in the [Flying Car Slack Community](https://udacity-flying-car.slack.com/messages/C77GCKZ8U) and on social media using the links below!\n\nMake sure to use **@Udacity**, **#flyingcarnd**, **#quadcontrol**, and **#madewithudacity** in your posts!\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html?size=l&url=www.udacity.com&text=I%20built%20a%20nonlinear%20cascaded%20controller%20in%20C++%20to%20perform%20various%20drone%20maneuvers%20in%20simulation!%20[Insert%20your%20Gif%20or%20youtube%20url%20here]&hashtags=flyingcarnd, quadcontrol, madewithudacity\"\nwidth=\"140\"\nheight=\"28\"\nscrolling=\"no\">\n</iframe>\n\n\n<html>\n\n<head>\n<style>\n.fb {color: white;\n  background-color: #4661b0;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  height: 28px;\n  font-size: 14px;}\n.fb:hover {color: #4661b0;\n  background-color: white;\n  border-color: #4661b0;\n  transition: background-color 0.4s}\n.linkedin {color: white;\n  background-color: #0077B5;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  height: 28px;\n  font-size: 14px;}\n.linkedin:hover {color: #0077B5;\n  background-color: white;\n  border-color: #0077B5;\n  transition: background-color 0.4s}\n</style>\n\n</head>\n\n<body>\n<form action=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?\">\n  Enter the full URL of your Gif or Youtube video:<br>\n  <input type=\"url\" name=\"u\" placeholder=\"Paste URL here\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hashtag\" value=\"#flyingcarnd\">\n  <button class=\"fb\">Share on Facebook</button>\n</form>\n\n<form action=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true\">\n  <input type=\"url\" name=\"url\" placeholder=\"Paste URL here\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"title\" value=\"Finding Lane Lines\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"summary\" value=\"I built a nonlinear cascaded controller in C++ to perform various drone maneuvers in simulation! @udacity #flyingcarnd #quadcontrol #madewithudacity\">\n  <button class=\"linkedin\">Share on LinkedIn</button>\n</form>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n",

Simply put: we didn't include enough support for incremental development and tuning of the individual controllers in the Python portion of the project. This meant that some students were spending hours and hours trying to tune their controllers (all without knowing whether their controller implementations were even correct). This is not a productive use of your valuable learning time! \n\nThe C++ portion of the project is broken into several smaller steps. Each of these steps provides some feedback on the correctness of your controller. You'll still have to deal with some of the pain of tuning, but it wouldn't be a controls project if that weren't the case.",

The simulator you'll be using in this project is more bare-bones than the Python / Unity simulator you've been working with so far, but it's more realistic in the physics that it models. \n\nOnce your controller meets the required specs with the C++ simulator, you'll have completed the project!  And for you more hardware minded students, you'll also be ready for running your controller on a real drone!\n\nBefore you can dive into writing your controller, we'll first set up the environment you'll be needing for your development in a couple steps:\n\n 1. Set up the C++ simulator and the development environment you'll need for it.\n 3. Get familiar with some of the tools you'll be able to use to evaluate your controller's performance.\n",

Feel free to use a copy of your own solution to the Backyard Flyer Project or the one in the link provided.\n\n### Step 1\n\nImport the `UnityDrone` and `NonlinearController` classes and modify the `BackyardFlyer` class to be a subclass of `UnityDrone` instead of `Drone`. `UnityDrone` is a subclass of `Drone`, so it provides all the functionality of `Drone` along with additional Unity specific commands/functionality (see below).\n\n```py\nfrom unity_drone import UnityDrone\nfrom controller import NonlinearController\n...\nclass BackyardFlyer(UnityDrone):\n```\n\n### Step 2\n\nAdd a controller object in the `__init__` method:\n\n```py\ndef __init__(self, connection):\n    ...\n    self.controller = NonlinearController()\n```\n\n### Step 3\n\nAdd the following three methods to your class to incorporate the controller into the backyard flyer.\n\n```py\n\ndef position_controller(self):\n    \"\"\"Sets the local acceleration target using the local position and local velocity\"\"\"\n    \n    (self.local_position_target, self.local_velocity_target, yaw_cmd) = self.controller.trajectory_control(self.position_trajectory, self.yaw_trajectory, self.time_trajectory, time.time())\n    self.attitude_target = np.array((0.0, 0.0, yaw_cmd))\n\n    acceleration_cmd = self.controller.lateral_position_control(self.local_position_target[0:2], self.local_velocity_target[0:2], self.local_position[0:2], self.local_velocity[0:2])\n    self.local_acceleration_target = np.array([acceleration_cmd[0], acceleration_cmd[1], 0.0])\n    \ndef attitude_controller(self):\n    \"\"\"Sets the body rate target using the acceleration target and attitude\"\"\"\n    self.thrust_cmd = self.controller.altitude_control(-self.local_position_target[2], -self.local_velocity_target[2], -self.local_position[2], -self.local_velocity[2], self.attitude, 9.81)\n    roll_pitch_rate_cmd = self.controller.roll_pitch_controller(self.local_acceleration_target[0:2], self.attitude, self.thrust_cmd)\n    yawrate_cmd = self.controller.yaw_control(self.attitude_target[2], self.attitude[2])\n    self.body_rate_target = np.array([roll_pitch_rate_cmd[0], roll_pitch_rate_cmd[1], yawrate_cmd])\n    \ndef bodyrate_controller(self):  \n    \"\"\"Commands a moment to the vehicle using the body rate target and body rates\"\"\"\n    moment_cmd = self.controller.body_rate_control(self.body_rate_target, self.gyro_raw)\n    self.cmd_moment(moment_cmd[0], moment_cmd[1], moment_cmd[2], self.thrust_cmd)\n```\n\n### Step 4\n\nRegister and add callbacks for the `RAW_GYROSCOPE`, `ATTITUDE`, and `LOCAL_VELOCITY` messages.  Note that you may already have the `velocity_callback()` function implemented; if so, replace `velocity_callback()` with the callback below.  Call the appropriate level of control in each callback (i.e. `bodyrate_controller()` is called in `gyro_callback()`):\n\n```py\ndef __init___(self,connection):\n    ...\n    self.register_callback(MsgID.ATTITUDE, self.attitude_callback)\n    self.register_callback(MsgID.RAW_GYROSCOPE, self.gyro_callback)\n    self.register_callback(MsgID.LOCAL_VELOCITY, self.velocity_callback)\n    \ndef attitude_callback(self):\n    ...\n    if self.flight_state == States.WAYPOINT:\n        self.attitude_controller()\n    \ndef gyro_callback(self):\n    ...\n    if self.flight_state == States.WAYPOINT:\n        self.bodyrate_controller()\n            \ndef velocity_callback(self):\n    ...\n    if self.flight_state == States.WAYPOINT:\n        self.position_controller()\n```\n\n### Step 5\n\nIn the waypoint transition method, replace the `self.cmd_position` method (which is disabled by `UnityDrone`) with setting the target local position. Note: `local_position_target` should be in NED coordinates, the backyard_flyer solution may calculate the box in NE altitude coordinates\n\n```py\n# replace this\nself.cmd_position(self.target_position[0], self.target_position[1], self.target_position[2], 0.0)\n\n# with this\nself.local_position_target = np.array((self.target_position[0], self.target_position[1], self.target_position[2]))\n```\n\n### Step 6\n\nFor this project we will no longer be flying the waypoint box, but rather a full flight trajectory, so remove calculate box and load the test trajectory:\n\n```py\n# replace this\nself.all_waypoints = self.calculate_box()\n\n# with this\n(self.position_trajectory, self.time_trajectory, self.yaw_trajectory) = self.load_test_trajectory(time_mult=0.5)\nself.all_waypoints = self.position_trajectory.copy()\nself.waypoint_number = -1\n```\n\n### Step 7\n\nAs our trajectory defines a waypoint with both time and location, change the transition criterion from proximity based to time based:\n\n```py\n# Replace this\nif np.linalg.norm(self.target_position[0:2] - self.local_position[0:2]) < 1.0:\n    ...\n\n# with this\nif time.time() > self.time_trajectory[self.waypoint_number]:\n    ...\n...\n\ndef waypoint_transition(self):\n    ...\n    self.waypoint_number = self.waypoint_number+1\n```\n\n### See what happens with no control\n\nNow your `backyard_flyer.py` solution is ready to use your custom controller.  Since you have yet to write any of the control functions, your quad will be incapable of flying, but just to make sure your script is working, start up the simulator and run your script:\n\n```sh\npython backyard_flyer.py\n```\n\nIf you've got everything set up properly, you should see your quad quite unceremoniously fall down to the ground!\n\nNow you have everything you need ready to go for the Python portion of the controls project.  Next, let's get everything set up for the C++ portion of the project.",

For example, for all your control gains and other desired tuning parameters, there is a config file called `QuadControlParams.txt` set up for you.  An import note is that while the simulator is running, you can edit this file in real time and see the affects your changes have on the quad!\n\nThe syntax of the config files is as follows:\n\n - `[Quad]` begins a parameter namespace.  Any variable written afterwards becomes `Quad.<variablename>` in the source code.\n - If not in a namespace, you can also write `Quad.<variablename>` directly.\n - `[Quad1 : Quad]` means that the `Quad1` namespace is created with a copy of all the variables of `Quad`.  You can then overwrite those variables by specifying new values (e.g. `Quad1.Mass` to override the copied `Quad.Mass`).  This is convenient for having default values.\n\nYou will also be using the simulator to fly some different trajectories to test out the performance of your C++ implementation of your controller.

Keeping in mind that the target platform for this code is a microcontroller, there are some additional factors you should consider:\n\n - Use floats, don’t use doubles (in practice, floats will run much faster on many microcontrollers than doubles)\n - Please don’t add additional library dependencies or allocate memory or use fancy STL features (you shouldn’t need to), if you keep your dependencies and code complexity down, the code you implement should easily port to real hardware. A real embedded environment is often stripped down to bare essentials, and even basic C++ STL features like `<string>` or `<map>` are often missing.\n\n\nFunctions you may find useful:\n\n - Lots of the code uses a data type called V3F, this is a convenience class for working with vectors of 3 floats.  For example, position/velocity/acceleration in 3D, body rates, etc.\n - `CONSTRAIN()` is a function that allows you to constrain your value within a set of bounds.  This is very helpful to have an upper and lower limit on a command (e.g. limiting a drone's bank angle).",

              "text": "# Parameter Tuning Tips and Tricks\n\nTuning the controller can be tricky. The parameters for your controller are defined in a file called `QuadControlParams.txt`. In that file you'll see the following initial values for the parameters\n\n```text\n# Position control gains\nkpPosXY = 1\nkpPosZ = 1\nKiPosZ = 20\n\n# Velocity control gains\nkpVelXY = 4\nkpVelZ = 4\n\n# Angle control gains\nkpBank = 5\nkpYaw = 1\n\n# Angle rate gains\nkpPQR = 23, 23, 5\n```\n\n**Approximate parameter values**\n\nThese initial values are all **too low**. To get our \"solution\" controller properly tuned we needed values that were between 2 and 4 times larger than the values shown here.\n\n**Approximate parameter ratios**\n\nSergei Lupashin put together a [one-page document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bgrkghpggnyc#/61023787/) deriving the ratio of velocity gains to position gains for a \"critically damped\" system (where the damping ratio is 1). In that document he shows that the ratio <span class=\"mathquill\">K_v / K_p = 4</span> for such a system. \n\n\n\n**Sequencing**\n\nThe C++ project is organized as a sequence of scenarios. Each scenario will have you implement one or two controllers and tune the associated parameters. If you can, try to keep the number of parameters that you're tuning at any given time small! For example, once you've tuned `kpPQR` and then moved on to the next controller, try to avoid further changes to `kpPQR`.\n\nDronecode provides some good [guidelines on PID tuning](https://docs.px4.io/en/advanced_config/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter.html#pid-controller-overview).\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThe C++ simulator and project scenarios were largely designed and built by [Fotokite](https://fotokite.com/). Big thanks to the Fotokite team (and Sergei Lupashin in particular) for their great work!\n\n",
