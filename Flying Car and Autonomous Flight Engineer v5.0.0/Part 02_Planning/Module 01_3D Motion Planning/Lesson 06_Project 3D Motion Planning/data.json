The starter files linked below are already on the VM in the folder called `/home/workspace/3D_motion_planning`. **NOTE: if you have already checked out the VM be sure to \"Reset data\" to get the latest files!**  If you choose to complete the project in the VM, follow the instructions [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd787/parts/5aa0a956-4418-4a41-846f-cb7ea63349b3/modules/0c12632a-b59a-41c1-9694-2b3508f47ce7/lessons/5f628104-5857-4a3f-93f0-d8a53fe6a8fd/concepts/ab09b378-f85f-49f4-8845-d59025dd8a8e?contentVersion=1.0.0&contentLocale=en-us) to get setup. \n\n2. If you're not going to work in the classroom VM, Download the Motion-Planning simulator for this project that's appropriate for your operating system from the [simulator releases respository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases)\n\n3.  Clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning)\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning\n```\n\n4. Run the `backyard_flyer_solution.py` script to fly a square flight pattern in this new environment as a test to see if everything is working as expected. \n\n5. Follow along with the [README](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/README.md) and the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) to complete the steps to a passing submission of this project.\n\nThis project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where you executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project you will integrate the techniques that you have learned throughout the last several lessons to plan a path through an urban environment.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nOnce you have completed your project, use the [**Project Rubric**](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in **any** category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working! \n\n## Submission\n\nYou may submit your project as a zip file or with a link to a GitHub repo. The submission must include\n1. A detailed writeup of your results including how you addressed each rubric point and where it appears in your code. \n2. The entire FCND-Motion-Planning folder with all of your code as scripts and / or notebooks. \n\nWhen you are ready to submit the project. Click on the \"Submit Project\" button and follow the instructions to submit!\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease fill out the [3D Motion Planning Project Feedback Form](https://goo.gl/forms/Biyb3q2AXVIxXqf62) after you have completed the project. \n\n## Share Your Project\nHave something fun to share? Did your drone fly safely from A to B or fly in upward circles around the same building? Perhaps your drone thought it was a frog and jumped from building top to building top? Either way, we love to see any and all of your creations!\n\nWhat youâ€™ve accomplished is no small feat. Give yourself a pat on the back and some well-deserved recognition by sharing your amazing project with your network.\n\nCreate a gif or youtube video of your project implementation in the simulator and share with us in the [Flying Car Slack Community](https://udacity-flying-car.slack.com/messages/C77GCKZ8U) and on social media using the links below!\n\nMake sure to use **@Udacity**, **#flyingcarnd**, **#3dplanning**, and **#madewithudacity** in your posts!\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/tweet_button.html?size=l&url=www.udacity.com&text=I%20engineered%20an%20autonomous%20drone%20to%20navigate%20in%20a%20city%20environment%20using%20path%20planning%20algorithms.%20Check%20it%20out!%20[Insert%20your%20Gif%20or%20youtube%20url%20here]&hashtags=flyingcarnd, 3dplanning, madewithudacity\"\nwidth=\"140\"\nheight=\"28\"\nscrolling=\"no\">\n</iframe>\n\n\n<html>\n\n<head>\n<style>\n.fb {color: white;\n  background-color: #4661b0;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  height: 28px;\n  font-size: 14px;}\n.fb:hover {color: #4661b0;\n  background-color: white;\n  border-color: #4661b0;\n  transition: background-color 0.4s}\n.linkedin {color: white;\n  background-color: #0077B5;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  height: 28px;\n  font-size: 14px;}\n.linkedin:hover {color: #0077B5;\n  background-color: white;\n  border-color: #0077B5;\n  transition: background-color 0.4s}\n</style>\n\n</head>\n\n<body>\n<form action=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?\">\n  Enter the full URL of your Gif or Youtube video:<br>\n  <input type=\"url\" name=\"u\" placeholder=\"Paste URL here\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hashtag\" value=\"#flyingcarnd\">\n  <button class=\"fb\">Share on Facebook</button>\n</form>\n\n<form action=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true\">\n  <input type=\"url\" name=\"url\" placeholder=\"Paste URL here\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"title\" value=\"Finding Lane Lines\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"summary\" value=\"I engineered an autonomous drone to navigate in a city environment using path planning algorithms.

Graphics rendering in the VM seems to work best for internet connections faster than 10Mbps, so if you're on a good connection we highly recommend checking it out! You can test the speed of your connection by going to [fast.com](https://fast.com/). Then simply follow along with these instructions for getting started and you'll be up and running in no time with your new VM.\n\n### Work on your local machine\n\nIf you would prefer to complete the project on your local machine, then you can skip ahead to the [instructions for local setup](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd787/parts/5aa0a956-4418-4a41-846f-cb7ea63349b3/modules/0c12632a-b59a-41c1-9694-2b3508f47ce7/lessons/5f628104-5857-4a3f-93f0-d8a53fe6a8fd/project).\n\n\n### VM Setup Instructions\n\nThe workspace VM is already setup with Python and the simulator for the 3D motion planning project. If you run into any problems with using the VM please file bugs, suggestions and grievances in the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/udacity/fcnd-issue-reports). \n\nWhen you click \"Next\" at the bottom of this page to advance to the 3D Motion Planning project in the classroom you'll first see a popup asking if you want to enable GPU mode. Choose \"yes\".",

The way this works is that when you click \"Submit Project\" in the workspace IDE, everything in your `/home/workspace` folder will be zipped up and submitted. So the first step is to move everything you do not want to submit out of the `/home/workspace` directory.\n\nThe one thing you absolutely must remove from `/home/workspace` is the simulator (with the simulator the submission would be too big and fail to go through). You can temporarily move this to /opt while you submit your project.\n\n```sh\ncd /home/workspace\nmv FCND-Sim-Linux /opt\n```\n\nNext, move any other files or folders you do not intend to submit out of `/home/workspace` and then click the \"Submit Project\" button at the lower right in your workspace IDE (note: not in the VM desktop environment, but next to the \"Go To Desktop\" button on the IDE page). \n\nWhen you have finished submitting, move any files you want to keep, including the simulator back into `/home/workspace` so they will be saved for your next visit to the VM.",
