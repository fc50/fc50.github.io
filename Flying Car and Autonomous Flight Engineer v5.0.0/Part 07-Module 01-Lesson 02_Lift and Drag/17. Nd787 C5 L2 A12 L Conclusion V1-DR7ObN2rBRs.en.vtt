00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
We started this lesson by defining

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.394
the frames of reference for fixed-wing longitudinal motion.

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:09.074
We then looked at the four forces that act on fixed wing vehicles

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:13.254
and identified the relevant reference frame and axis for each force.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:14.835
Of these four forces,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.140
two of them were familiar: weight and thrust.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.594
But, the two aerodynamic forces: lift and drag were just simple.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:25.849
We came up with mathematical models for these forces and the pitching moment,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.760
M. You were able to use these forces to solve for

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.155
trim states like straight level flight and climbing flight.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.550
These trim states are really important.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:35.989
At the end of this module,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.804
you'll be asked to implement a controller for fixed-wing flight,

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.600
and a big part of that controller's job will be to identify

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.130
the appropriate term values for the propulsion system and the control surfaces.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.370
In the next two lessons,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.199
we'll come up with full mathematical models for fixed-wing dynamics.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.050
First for longitudinal motion and then for lateral directional motion.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.834
In the last lesson of this module,

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:00.240
you'll learn how to implement an autopilot for fixed-wing flight.
