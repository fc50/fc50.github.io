00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.924
The second major aerodynamic force acting on the vehicle is drag.

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.519
Drag always points parallel to the direction of airflow relative to the vehicle,

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.129
which means it acts to resist forward motion.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.160
There are actually two forms of drag.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.839
The first is called parasitic drag and this is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519
just the resistance the air puts up against any body moving through it.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.745
The other form of drag is called lift induced drag.

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.339
Remember, that when a wing is producing lift

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.105
the incoming air flows over the top and bottom of the wing at different speeds.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.800
When these flows are joined,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.695
they tend to get deflected downwards,

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:35.255
this is called downwash.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:36.690
So for this wing,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.589
we have the relative airflow coming into the wind like this and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.000
the effective relative airflow leaving the wing like this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.840
Now, we define lift to be

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.140
the aerodynamic force that's perpendicular to the relative airflow.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
So, the lift in this case has to point like this,

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.869
but since the effective airflow that the wing sees

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.274
is actually rotated by this downwash angle,

00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:59.769
the effective lift will also be rotated by the same amount.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.710
This rotated effective lift vector has a component that points parallel to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.465
the incoming relative airflow and that component is what we call lift induced drag.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.125
So, when we model drag,

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.025
we'll model it as some non-dimensional coefficient,

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:14.455
times the dynamic pressure,

00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:17.024
times the surface area of the wing.

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:20.790
This coefficient will be the sum of two other coefficients.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.525
The first is the coefficient of parasitic drag

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.900
and the second is the coefficient of lift induced drag.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.280
This second coefficient is itself a function of the lift coefficient we saw before.
