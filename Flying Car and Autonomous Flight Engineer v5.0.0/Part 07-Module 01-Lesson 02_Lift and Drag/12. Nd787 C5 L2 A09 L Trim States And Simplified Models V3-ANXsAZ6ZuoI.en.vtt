00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.475
At this point, we've developed a mathematical model for lift,

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:05.634
drag and pitching moment.

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:08.809
Each of these models has a coefficient associated with it.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.870
It's important to remember that these equations are models of reality,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.864
and these models are not perfect.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.230
When we make models,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.600
we want them to be accurate and simple.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.760
Often, we make assumptions that may make

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.375
our model slightly less accurate in order to keep it simple.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.870
For example, in reality,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.390
these forces and moments also depend on a pitch rate of the vehicle,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.429
which we've been representing with Q.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.479
But this contribution is generally small for normal flight,

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.289
so we've ignored it in these models.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.339
But what is normal flight for a fixed-wing aircraft?

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.805
With a few exceptions,

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:46.414
fixed-wing vehicles usually operate at or very near some sort of trim state.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:49.000
A trim state is simply an equilibrium state where

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.395
the net force and net moment on the vehicle are zero.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.585
One common trim state is straight and level flight.

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.700
This is flight where the vehicles flying in

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.730
a straight and level flight path at constant speed.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.044
Straight means the vehicle isn't turning,

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:05.905
and level means it stays at constant altitude.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.379
Note that the level in straight and level flight

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:10.869
doesn't refer to the orientation of the vehicle,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.875
but to the fact that its altitude isn't changing.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:18.200
Now we'd like to use our models to answer some questions about this trim state.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700
For example, if I want to fly at a certain velocity,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.640
I might want to know how much thrust should the propulsion system provide?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.219
What angle of attack should I try to fly at?

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.025
In general, the answer will not be zero.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:33.390
What elevator deflection angle will I need?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.519
We would like to answer these questions using a model that's

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:40.269
as simple as possible without sacrificing too much accuracy.

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:44.634
Let's consider the forces acting on an aircraft in straight and level flight.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:49.570
There's the weight, lift, thrust, and drag.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.639
Since this is a trim state,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.265
the forces must balance in a horizontal or vertical direction.

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.915
This is fairly straightforward analysis.

00:01:57.915 --> 00:01:59.900
The most important thing to remember is that we

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.840
need the lift force to match the weight force.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.454
There is a vertical component of thrust that will help match the weight force,

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.294
but we won't be pitched by much, so let's ignore that.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.889
For a level flight, that our pitch is the same as our angle of attack,

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.704
and that's where lift comes from.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:17.810
We just need to pitch up enough to make sure our lift matches our weight.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.129
But if we're pitched up, then we'll have a pitching moment too.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.155
That will cause the vehicle to start rotating upwards,

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:25.824
increasing our angle of attack,

00:02:25.824 --> 00:02:28.929
creating more lift and causing us to gain altitude.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.944
To avoid that, we need to counteract the pitching moment with the elevator.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.000
It might seem counter intuitive,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.764
but in level flight will deflect the elevator downwards,

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:42.024
just enough to counteract the pitching moment of the positive angle of attack.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:44.840
The elevator will also contribute to the lift,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.020
but near this trim state the elevator deflection will be really small

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.960
and the contribution of this term will be negligible compared to the other terms.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.105
That means, for this example,

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.544
we can ignore this terms impact on lift.

00:02:56.544 --> 00:03:00.739
We'll walk through some of this math in more detail next.
