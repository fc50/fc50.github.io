00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
We have a basic conceptual model for lift,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.094
and now would like to know how to calculate lift.

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:06.990
The first thing we need to do is bring in

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.509
a concept called the non-dimensional coefficient.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.900
Calculating the lift of a wing is computationally costly

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
and involves integrating the dynamic pressure over every point on the wing.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.860
When people were designing wings in the 20th century,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
it was really expensive to build those models and they needed a way to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.450
avoid having to recreate the model for a wing in different conditions.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.050
What you really want is a single number that could predict the force

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.969
produced under a range of conditions like the speed of the vehicle,

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.594
the density of air and the size of the wing.

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.414
Because you multiply that single number by the relevant dimensions so you get the force,

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:45.420
this number is called the non-dimensional coefficient of lift.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.460
We are going to define the total lift force as L equals

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.155
C sub L Qbar S. S is the area of the wing.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.439
That's something that we can calculate based on the geometry of our wing.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.890
Qbar is the dynamic pressure,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.570
and that is going to depend on the air speed and the air density.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.159
Specifically, Q bar is 1.5 rho times V squared.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.709
Rho here is the density of air,

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.084
and it's a function of altitude and temperature.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:15.890
There are good models for air density that we can use to look this up.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.060
V is the speed of the aircraft through the air,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.060
and we can get this either from an air speed sensor or we can

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.439
estimate it using state estimation techniques from other sensors.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.129
That just leaves the lift coefficient C sub L,

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:32.375
and this is typically a non-linear function of the angle of attack Alpha,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.484
the pitch rate Q and the elevator deflection

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:39.185
delta E. This non-linear function is hard to model exactly.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:43.144
So, we'll use a first order tailor series approximation to write

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:47.659
C sub L as C sub L naught plus C sub L

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.019
alpha times alpha plus C sub L delta E times delta

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.879
E. This first term is the coefficient of lift at zero angle of attack.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:02.474
This next term is the lift slope and it tells us how lift changes with angle of attack.

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:05.689
This last term is the dimensionless control derivative and

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.974
it tells us how lift changes with elevator deflection.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:11.479
Note that this model assumes low angles of attack,

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.649
small elevator deflection and zero pitch rate.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.469
It's important to remember that every part of the aircraft generate some lift.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.240
The fuselage and the horizontal tail generate lift, for example.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.365
For small aircraft, we can generally ignore these contributions,

00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:28.640
but for bigger flying car that's actually carrying people,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.359
it would be better to model each of these separately.
