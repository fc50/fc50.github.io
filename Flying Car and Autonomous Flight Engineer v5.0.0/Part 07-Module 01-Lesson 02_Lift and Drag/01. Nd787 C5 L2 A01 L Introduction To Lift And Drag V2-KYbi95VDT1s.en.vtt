00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome back. To understand how to control a fixed-wing aircraft,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.520
we need a better understanding of

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.234
the underlying Physics than we needed when controlling a quadrotor.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:12.629
If you think back to the controls module from the first term,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.080
you might remember that our model of quadrotor Physics was pretty simple.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.789
The model you used only considered two types of forces,

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.234
the weight of the quadrotor,

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:24.989
which I always pointed down in the global frame and the thrust from

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.119
each of the four propellers each of which always points up in the body frame.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.039
What about fixed-wing vehicles?

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.549
Let's consider a plane flying in straight and level flight at constant speed.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.029
This aircraft will experience a weight force from

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.594
gravity which points down in the global frame.

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.189
It will also experience a thrust force from

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.989
the propulsion system but this points

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.079
forward in the body frame of the aircraft instead of upwards.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.199
But the thing that makes fixed-wing dynamics more complex than

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.295
quadrotor dynamics are the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:01:00.990
Drag is a force that points opposite the direction of motion of the vehicle.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.980
For this plane traveling in straight and level flight,

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.694
drag would point directly behind the vehicle.

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:10.344
Lift is generated by the wing as it moves through the air.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:13.950
For this aircraft, lift would point in this direction.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.790
This lesson is all about understanding and modeling

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.829
these two forces but before we can build a model for these forces,

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:24.559
it will help to do a quick review of some of the relevant Physics.
