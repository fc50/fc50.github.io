00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Up until this point, we've been talking about thrust, weight,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.339
lift, and drag, without really discussing where these forces come from.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.714
Thrust and weight are forces that you should be familiar with.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:15.449
Weight is just the mass of an object times the acceleration due to gravity.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.910
Thrust is what we call the force generated by

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.280
a propulsion system like a propeller or a jet engine.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.955
The details of how these propulsion systems work

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.559
are something we can safely ignore for our purposes,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.099
so we can continue to take thrust as a given.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.399
But we will need to know a bit more about lift and drag.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.155
These forces are both aerodynamic forces,

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:40.424
which means they come from the relative motion between a body like a plane and the air.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:41.989
Let's start with lift.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.800
The key concept is what's called "dynamic pressure."

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.599
Dynamic pressure is the pressure caused by the motion of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.320
a body like a wing through a fluid, like air.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.155
Note that the body doesn't have to be a wing.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.560
For example, imagine some rectangular block travelling to the left through the air.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.045
As it moves, the air will exert a pressure everywhere on the block.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.260
Now, some of that pressure comes from the fact

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.270
that the body is actually pushing on the air.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.774
You felt this pressure if you've ever stuck your hand out of the window of a car,

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:17.010
but this only explains a small portion of how a wing generates lift.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.980
Here, you can see the cross-section of a wing.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.750
As a wing moves through the air,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.379
there is smooth or what's called laminar flow over the top and the bottom of the wing.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.664
Due to the shape of the wing,

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:33.010
the air will tend to flow faster over the top of the wing and slower over the bottom.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.260
This faster flowing air has lower pressure

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.704
than the slower moving air on the bottom of the wing.

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:41.299
Since pressure is just a force exerted over an area,

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.344
lower pressure means less force.

00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:46.239
So, this pressure differential between the top and bottom of

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.280
the wing means there's actually a net force that points upwards on the wing.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.920
An important thing to note is that this method of generating lift relies on laminar flow,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.344
but this laminar flow can be disrupted.

00:01:57.344 --> 00:01:59.989
In general, it's easy to maintain laminar flow when

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.324
the angle of attack is low and when maneuvers are gentle.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.710
But when the angle of attack increases beyond a certain threshold,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.924
the flow can become separated from the wing.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.780
In this case, the airflow over the top of the wing becomes

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.534
turbulent and the wings suddenly produces significantly less lift.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.259
This is called "stall."

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.389
The mathematical models for lift that we discussed in this module

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.599
do not explicitly account for the critical stall angle,

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.840
but an autopilot would need to incorporate that angle into its control decisions.
