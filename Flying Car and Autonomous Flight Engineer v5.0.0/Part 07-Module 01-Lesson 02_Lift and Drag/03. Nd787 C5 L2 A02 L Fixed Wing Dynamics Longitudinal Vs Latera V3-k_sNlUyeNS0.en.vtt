00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
To understand the motion of a fixed-wing vehicle,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.865
we need to understand how it moves and rotates in all three dimensions.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:10.929
But a complete 3D analysis of the forces can get very complicated very quickly.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.684
To avoid this complexity,

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.225
we often split the four or 3-dimensional analysis

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:17.725
into two separate 2-dimensional problems,

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.405
the longitudinal motion and the lateral motion.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:22.960
When we analyze the longitudinal motion,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.894
we typically think of a picture like this where we view the vehicle from the side.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.449
This is the picture we used in the previous quizzes.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.804
It's also the picture we'll be using for the majority of this lesson as well as the next.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:35.854
When we analyze a lateral motion,

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:39.259
we either look at the plane from above or from behind.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.099
We'll be analyzing lateral dynamics in the lesson after the next lesson.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.929
Each of these pictures is useful for

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.715
understanding various aspects of the vehicles motion.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:51.500
For example, longitudinal analysis helps us understand how

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.729
the aircraft pitch changes over time

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.750
while lateral analysis helps us understand roll and yaw.
