00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
It'd be a lot easier if I had an actual model airplane to show you

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.640
some of the concepts I'm going to talk about today. Thanks plane fairy.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.355
In some of the previous quizzes,

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:13.835
you saw a picture of a plane travelling forward at some constant speed,

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:16.480
and this picture is relatively easy to analyze.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.705
Thrust points forwards, drag points backwards,

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.889
weight points down, and lift points up.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.660
When I talk about this plane,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929
I can use words like up, down, forwards,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.649
and backwards unambiguously since the axes of the body frame of

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.989
the aircraft point in the same direction as

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.385
the axes of the global or inertial frame of reference,

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.289
but that's not generally true.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.089
To keep track of the dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.635
we actually need multiple frames of reference.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:46.129
When analyzing the longitudinal motion,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.469
there are three frames that we'll discuss.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.670
We can see the need for each of these reference frames by watching a plane as it lands.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.655
Consider this plane as it approaches the runway to land.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:00.774
Since it's descending, the velocity vector points forwards and downwards.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:04.004
But, when we're analyzing the forces on a plane,

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:05.634
the velocity of the plane,

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:06.960
relative to the ground,

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.375
isn't nearly as important as the velocity of the air relative to the plane.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.049
So, if it's a still day and there's zero wind,

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.664
then from the plane's point of view,

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:19.975
the airstream will be coming in the opposite direction, like this.

00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:22.589
So, we'll call this V sub air.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.000
Note that the aircraft itself will be generally pitched upwards.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.709
The important thing to note here is that the direction of travel is

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.034
not the same as the direction that the nose is pointing.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:35.584
Now, let's analyze the forces acting on this plane.

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:38.429
We're going to add four more arrows to this diagram.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.160
Keep in mind that this arrow,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.489
V sub air, is not a force.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:47.009
It's just there to remind us what direction the air is moving relative to the plane.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.195
For the first force, we have weight.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:51.149
Weight is going to point in this direction since

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.380
gravity always points to the center of the Earth.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.009
Next, we have drag.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.565
Drag always points parallel to the relative airflow,

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.325
so it's going to point this way.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:03.710
Next is thrust. The direction of thrust is determined by their propulsion system,

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.399
but generally it will be in the same direction that the nose of the plane is pointed in.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.599
So, it might look something like this.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.829
Finally, lift always points perpendicular to incoming airflow,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620
so it point in this direction.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.055
Note that lift does not point normal to the surface of the wings.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.944
Lift and drag are always at right angles to each other.

00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:25.938
Now, hidden in these four force vectors and one velocity vector,

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.909
are actually three frames of reference that we need to keep track of

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.639
when analyzing the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle.
