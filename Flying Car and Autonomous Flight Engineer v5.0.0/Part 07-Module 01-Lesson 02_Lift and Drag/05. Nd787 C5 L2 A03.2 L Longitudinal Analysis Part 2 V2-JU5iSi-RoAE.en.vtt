00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
So, what are these three hidden frames of reference?

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.609
First, we have the inertial frame of reference.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.355
You might also see this referred to as the world or global frame.

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:13.150
This is just the Northeast down frame you've seen before.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.629
The Z-axis of this frame is parallel to the gravity vector.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.164
The X-axis points North and the Y-axis points East,

00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:22.119
though we can't see it in this picture.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.179
Next, we have the body frame.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.429
The origin of this frame is at the center of mass of the vehicle.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.295
The X-axis points out of the nose and the Z-axis points down through the fuselage.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.380
As you can see, the thrust vector is aligned to the X-axis of this frame.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.650
Finally, we have what's called the stability frame.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.710
The stability frame is actually determined by the direction of this arrow which,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.429
remember, is the velocity of the air relative to the plane.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.244
In this example, we're imagining zero wind.

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:53.890
So, this vector is just the opposite of the plane's velocity vector,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.174
but you could imagine,

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:56.919
that would change if there were wind.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.804
As you can see, drag points in the negative X direction in the stability frame,

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:03.034
and lift points in the negative Z direction.

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:05.539
In addition to these three frames of reference,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.905
there are three important angles that are used to relate these frames.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:11.030
If we ignore the forces for a moment,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.640
what we have is a plane pointed in this direction,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.805
relative airflow coming in at this direction,

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.795
and that this line is horizontal in the inertial frame.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:23.099
The angle between the body frame in horizontal in the inertial frame is Theta.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:24.989
This is the pitch angle of the vehicle.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.140
The angle between the airflow and the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.075
horizontal is the flight path angle and it's labeled Gamma.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:35.715
Finally, the angle between the airflow and the body frame is called the angle of attack,

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:37.625
and it's usually labeled Alpha.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.010
These three angles are useful when you need to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.200
rotate forces into different frames of reference.
