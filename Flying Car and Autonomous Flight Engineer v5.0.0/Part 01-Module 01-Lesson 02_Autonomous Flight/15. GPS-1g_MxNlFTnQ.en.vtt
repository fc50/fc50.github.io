00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.003
Before talking about GPS, I should at least mention that with a super accurate IMU,

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.000
it is possible to integrate the measured accelerations to get velocities,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
and again, integrate those velocities to get an estimate of the position of the vehicle.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.794
But, such accurate IMUs are very heavy,

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:17.864
power hungry, and extremely expensive.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:20.599
So, these are not what you'll be flying in your quadrotor.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.500
Instead, you'll be using the signal from

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.315
the Global Positioning System or GPS to measure your latitude and longitude as you fly.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.070
Just like on your smartphone,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.009
you can equip your quadrotor with a small GPS receiver like

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.158
this to get constant updates on the position of the vehicle.

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:38.444
As you may have noticed with your phone, however,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.993
GPS sometimes gives an imperfect position estimate.

00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:44.908
We've all experienced that moment when we're walking down

00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:49.109
the street following the blue dot on our phone as it moves across the map.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.350
And then suddenly, the dot jumps across the street.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.804
This isn't a problem for us walking on the sidewalk,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.493
but for a quadrotor using GPS for position information,

00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:00.899
it wouldn't know whether it's just an anomaly,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.804
or whether a gust of wind came,

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:05.430
and actually blew the vehicle across the street.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.255
To mitigate such problems,

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.823
other kinds of on-board sensors such as cameras,

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.765
laser rangefinders, a compass, a barometer,

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:15.195
or even the IMU itself can also be used

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.804
in order to give the vehicle a sense of where it is in space,

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:21.720
or whether a sudden jump in GPS position is actually valid.

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:25.378
For example, if the GPS position jumps 50 meters to the left,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:28.542
but no corresponding acceleration was sense in the IMU,

00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:31.275
you can probably assume it was a GPS anomaly.

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:33.330
Fusing all of the different sources of

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:36.479
sensor information is a challenge in and of itself,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.484
which we'll get into later in the program.

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:40.994
But for now, and in the upcoming project,

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:44.130
you'll be using simulated GPS to get your position coordinates.
