00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
So, now you have a quadrotor consisting of an airframe with motors,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.638
and propellers, and speed controllers,

00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:09.540
being driven by an autopilot to adjust the vehicle attitude,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.880
which is constantly being measured by the IMU,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.190
and your position is provided by GPS.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.040
But then what? How do you execute a mission?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.640
Of course, you could just have a human pilot,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.095
but this program is all about autonomous flight.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:23.955
So how do you replace the human?

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:26.550
Well, you need a brain on board of course,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.280
and the flight computer will be the brain for the vehicle.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.425
The flight computer, like this one,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:35.670
is generally responsible for all parts of the mission including for example,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
planning a safe trajectory through obstacles and managing

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.527
the payload or position estimation when GPS's flaking them.

00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:44.295
If the flight computer is the brain,

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:48.000
you can think of the autopilot as more like the spinal cord or lizard

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.058
brain stem of the vehicle responsible for lower level processes.

00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:54.870
And then, the flight computer is responsible for

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.725
higher level functions like deciding what the vehicle should do next,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.875
and how it should respond to new information.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:03.375
There are in fact,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:08.640
multiple levels of control on any autonomous system and drones are no exception.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.410
The way the whole system;

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.460
the flight computer, autopilot, sensors,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.740
and mechanical parts function together

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.590
is through a series of what are known as control loops.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.510
So let's draw this out.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.099
First, you have your autopilot,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.360
which is getting information about attitude from the IMU.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.130
It compares that with a target attitude and send's small adjustments to the motors,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.843
which act to change the attitude of the quad,

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:37.595
and the cycle continues with the IMU making a new measurement.

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:40.330
So, this is the attitude control loop,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.410
where the autopilot is constantly updating the motor

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.305
thrusts based on sensor data from the IMU.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.970
This loop is always running in the background and just like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.095
your brainstem keeps your vital organs working without you having to pay attention.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:53.666
On top of that,

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.125
there's a position control loop.

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:56.805
Sometimes it's in the autopilot,

00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:00.600
but more often it's in the flight computer where the position control loop is receiving

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.755
information about the vehicle position from GPS or other sensors,

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:09.345
and computing a target thrust vector in order to move to the desired position.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:12.735
That thrust vector command is then sent to the autopilot loop,

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.540
which in turn adjusts the motor thrusts to achieve

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
that new attitude and the cycle continues with the GPS making new measurements.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.690
These loops do not need to be synchronized and most often they're not.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.210
The autopilot loop might be executing at 50 cycles per second or 50 hertz.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.090
While the position loop might only be executing a few times per second.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.525
So the way this works is that for instance,

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.670
if the mission is to inspect a wind turbine,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.825
the flight computer will be responsible for working out how to fly that mission

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.060
or in other words what the vehicle trajectory should

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.790
look like as a series of positions in space.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.430
And the autopilot will be responsible for executing

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.890
that plan as it gets regular updates from

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.840
the flight computer on how to adjust

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.808
the thrust vector to arrive at the desired series of positions.

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:57.874
And there you have it.

00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:59.690
Your quadrotor has a brain!
