00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
We'll be using the quadrotor drone as our test platform for learning about flying cars.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.330
But first, I figure we should pause for

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.060
a moment and talk about just what to call these things.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.175
Within the world of flying robots,

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.120
you'll hear people argue about whether the proper name is UAV or UAS,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.050
which stands for unmanned aerial vehicle or unmanned aerial system.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.330
You'll also hear the names quadrotor,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.020
quadcopter, multirotor, and drone used to describe these.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.815
For our purposes, the name is not particularly relevant, call it what you will.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.010
We'll be working with a small helicopter that has four rotors.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.050
I might sometimes called the drone a quadrotor or maybe even just a quad,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.660
but just know that I'm always referring to the same thing.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.135
You might also wonder why four rotors,

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:45.015
why not three or six or eight?

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.730
The truth is that other multi rotor configurations

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.040
would be equally valid as an experimental platform.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.770
But the convenience symmetry of quadrotors and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.515
the fact that they are the most common drones available for purchase,

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.615
make them an obvious choice for this program.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:01.020
So, why are people talking so much about drones these days?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.690
Well, a couple of things have changed in recent years.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.919
They make this an exciting time to be working on them.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:11.760
One is that we now have low cost high power microelectronics that have allowed us to take

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.514
the autopilots that have kept aircraft flying on

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.910
a straight and level for many decades and make them much cheaper,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.380
smaller, and lighter so that we can put them on much smaller aircraft.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.610
We want these tiny aircraft to perform more and more complicated missions so that as

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.660
we take the human pilot out of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.765
the equation we need to replace that human with a computer.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:33.240
So another advantage of cheap microelectronics

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.760
is that small computers are widely available and

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.160
capable of performing complex in-flight data

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.085
crunching tasks that used to require a human brain.

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:44.100
Another thing that has changed is how we power our aircraft.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.160
Most aircraft for the past 100 years had been powered using

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.320
carbon-based fuels such as jet fuel or gasoline.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.230
But now we have access to high energy density batteries and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.370
high power density batteries that can be used to power small aircraft like a quadrotor.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.180
And finally, a major development in the last 30 years or so has

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.870
been the availability of the global positioning system or GPS.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.020
A small drone can now be outfitted with a GPS receiver and get

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.895
constant updates on its position which is a tremendous aid to autonomous navigation.

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:14.605
So with the advent of

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:18.130
powerful lightweight computers and batteries as well as GPS for navigation,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.160
we're at an amazing moment in history where tiny flying machines can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.580
autonomously perform incredibly complex tasks and that is

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.650
why the modern quadrotor drone serves as

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.450
a perfect test platform for developing algorithms to control the flying car.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.050
Now, you might already own a quadcopter or you might be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.205
considering building one to test your code on as you go through this program.

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.200
So next, I'll talk a bit about

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.740
the various components that make up a quadrotor drone and what

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.590
the trade-offs are in each case when deciding

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.770
which components to select if you decide to build your own drone.
