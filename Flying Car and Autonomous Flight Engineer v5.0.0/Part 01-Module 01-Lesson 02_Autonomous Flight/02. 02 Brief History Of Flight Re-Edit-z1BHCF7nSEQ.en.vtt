00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first people to fly a manned and powered

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.795
airplane back in 1903 near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.590
Many people before them had been trying to figure out how to fly.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.910
But no one else had succeeded,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.390
because they were attempting to make planes that were very stable and easy to control.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.210
These earlier planes were designed to keep flying and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.435
just needed the pilot to steer, as if navigating a ship.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.315
The Wright brothers spent time watching how birds fly,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.090
lying on their backs out on the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.870
watching the buzzards wheel around up in the sky.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.775
They noticed that the bird swooped and turned by constantly adjusting themselves,

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.097
reacting to the wind,

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:36.670
doing things like changing the shape of

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.790
their wings to induce a bank maneuver in a given direction.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.550
The key thing they discovered by watching the birds,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.370
was that stable flight requires active control.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.290
Previous aircraft designs that had attempted to enable passive stability had failed,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.210
because flight is inherently dynamic.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.637
The Wright brothers design their airplane,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.125
not to be particularly stable,

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.220
but it gave the pilot much more control through things like adjustable wings

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.495
that'll let the pilot fly just like a bird.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.430
These adjustable wings and other controls that they had,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.880
they were the early forerunners of modern control surfaces like ailerons.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.860
The sacrifice of stability in exchange for

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.605
greater control is what made the first flight successful.

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:16.005
Once the Wright brothers were in the air, however,

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.410
they found that controlling the aircraft had built and navigating in flight.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.870
These are really complicated tasks to do together,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.440
and required the pilot to be simultaneously keeping the aircraft level,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.255
while maintaining a particular heading,

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:30.105
and keeping an eye on the ground to know where they were on the map.

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:34.845
The Wright Brothers and other folks struggled with how to make flying less complicated.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:38.055
And just about 10 years later, in 1912,

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:41.130
Elmer Sperry invented the very first autopilot known as

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.600
the Mechanical Mike which was basically a device with a couple of gyroscopes inside,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.405
that allowed for monitoring the heading and pitch of the aircraft

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:51.780
in order to automatically stay on a level and stable trajectory.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.225
Airplanes were not yet completely autonomous.

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.485
But as you can already see,

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:56.940
more than 100 years ago,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.880
we'd begun building semi-autonomous flying machines.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.525
The past century has seen dramatic improvements to autopilot technology.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.915
And now, commercial aircraft routinely fly for

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:09.705
hours at a time in fully autonomous autopilot mode.

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:12.270
And the military flies planes with no pilot on board at all.
