00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.929
The frame for your quad is really just a rigid mount for the motors and electronics.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.740
For the vast majority of quadrotor helicopters,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.185
there really isn't anything that special about the frame.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.105
It's just the base to which everything else is connected.

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:16.269
The frame has to be strong enough to support the components of the vehicle,

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.338
yet light enough that it can be lifted along with

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:21.238
all the other components by the motors and propellers.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.138
But other than that, you don't need to worry

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.274
much about aerodynamics or other complications.

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:28.478
That said, there are people working on

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.469
different materials and different designs for frames.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.950
So, I don't mean to say that there aren't a lot of interesting questions to be answered,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.359
but frankly, you can make

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.094
a perfectly serviceable quadrotor frame out of household materials.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:42.609
There's even a company out there that sells

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.125
drone kits where you build the frame out of Lego.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:49.899
The simplicity of the frame is one of the big differences between multi rotor drones and

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.439
other more conventional aircraft where things like

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.179
aerodynamics and structural integrity are a much bigger concern.
