00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
The next component of your quadrotor to think about is the power supply, the battery.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.184
Most quadrotors and other electric propulsion aircraft

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:10.214
use lithium polymer or LiPo batteries, like this one.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:15.660
These are basically the same battery technology that's in your cell phone or your laptop.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.170
However, quadrotor batteries are a little bit different in

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.538
their design because they need to be able to discharge very quickly.

00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:25.530
This makes them a lot more dangerous than

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.109
the batteries in your laptop or your cell phones.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.780
And consequently, LiPo batteries also have to be charged very carefully.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.314
It's worth noting that in most quadrotor batteries,

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.000
there are actually multiple batteries in one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.429
And so you have to think about making sure that

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.715
each cell of the battery is charged the same as the others,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:47.240
so that one cell of the battery isn't discharging into another.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.445
We'll talk more about safety and balancing batteries later on in the program.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.460
For now, suffice it to say that in choosing a battery,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.750
you just need to make sure it has

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.005
enough capacity to fly the kinds of missions you want to fly,

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.880
which means first and foremost,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.483
that it has enough power to lift the vehicle and payload,

00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:08.910
but also that it be able to comfortably last for the duration of the mission.
