00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
There's a huge variety of aircraft designs that could be used to make a flying car.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.125
When most people think of flying cars,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.515
they often think of literally a car with wings and propellers.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.825
In reality, flying cars will not look like this,

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:14.459
but it's an interesting starting point.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
Real flying cars will have wings or propellers or both.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.714
Basically, they could be like normal airplanes,

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:22.739
what we call fixed-wing aircraft,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.184
or they might look more like a helicopter,

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:27.644
which is often referred to as a rotary-wing aircraft.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:29.640
Did you know that the rotating blades are actually

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.905
acting as wings to keep the aircraft in the air?

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.520
Fixed-wing aircraft do have a huge advantage in terms of efficiency,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.675
allowing them to go much faster and fly much further than rotary-wing aircraft.

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:43.469
But helicopters have a much bigger advantage for flying cars in

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.579
that they can take off and land vertically or what we call VTOL capability.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.219
Remember that fixed-wing aircraft requires a runway.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.379
Being able to take off and land vertically is

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.740
a huge advantage when operating in complex urban environments,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.020
which is exactly where flying cars will be operating.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.425
Helicopters are not the only vehicles that are capable of VTOL, mind you.

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.599
There are aircraft that can rotate their propellers,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.105
like the V-22 Osprey used by the US Marines.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.410
There are aircraft that can vector

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.795
the engine thrust downwards, like the Harrier Jump Jet.

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.920
There are aircraft that have two propulsion systems,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.329
like the F-35B with its lift fan.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.899
Or aircraft that are actually designed to sit on their tail at takeoff,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.765
and then pitch over into forward flight once they're in the air.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.885
These aircraft have different tradeoffs in terms of stability and control.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.505
And, as the Wright brothers discovered,

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:27.109
this tradeoff really matters.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.299
For flying cars, the jury is still out on what

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.344
the best vehicle design type or morphology is going to be.

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:35.734
In this program, we're going to begin with a multi-rotor vehicle,

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:37.189
but in term two of the program,

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.519
we'll study fixed-wing aircraft as well.
