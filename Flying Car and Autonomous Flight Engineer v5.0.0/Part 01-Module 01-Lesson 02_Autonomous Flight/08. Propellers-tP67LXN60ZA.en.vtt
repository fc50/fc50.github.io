00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Each of the motors on your quad is attached to a propeller.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.750
The thrust along each arm of

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.288
the quadrotor is a function of how fast each motor is spinning.

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:14.028
But the thrust also depends on what the properties are of the propeller you're spinning.

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:17.149
First off, propellers drive air in a particular direction.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:18.333
There are either a tractor,

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:20.664
which pulls air downward through the propeller,

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.195
or a pusher, which pushes air upwards.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:25.310
Can you guess which of these two configurations

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.574
the propellers on a quadrotor are typically in?

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:29.644
If guessed tractor, you're correct.

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:34.085
The four propellers on your quad pull the air downward driving the vehicle upward.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.590
Propellers also have a direction of rotation.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.210
In quadrotors, you have

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.094
two counter-clockwise rotors and

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.390
two clockwise rotors in order to allow for zero net torque.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.923
Propellers also have a radius.

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:51.173
Bigger props generally can spin more slowly so they are quieter and more efficient,

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:52.713
but they also take up more room.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:54.695
So, you can see that on a quadrotor,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.070
given the size of your frame,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.060
there's going to be an upper limit on the size of your propellers.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.070
Another property for propellers is what's called pitch.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.129
If you look at the blades of a propeller,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.719
you'll see that they're not flat,

00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:08.544
but they're twisted out of the plane of rotation.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.109
It's that twist that we call the pitch of the propeller.

00:01:12.108 --> 00:01:14.598
You can think of a propeller as a screw.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:16.698
And if you put the propeller in some kind of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.180
soft substance or viscous fluid as you turn the propeller,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.890
it's the blades, the twisted blades that are

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.468
going to cause the propellers to move forward.

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:26.479
Similarly, the pitch of the threads on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.810
a screw caused the screw to move forward into some substance like wood.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.719
More formally, the pitch is the linear distance of

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.973
the propeller would move forward as the result of one rotation.

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:38.719
So, you can have large pitch props,

00:01:38.718 --> 00:01:41.303
which are going to move more air per revolution,

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:43.205
or you can have low pitch props,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.413
which are much flatter and they move less air per revolution.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:48.755
Larger pitch props are generally more efficient.

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:52.155
And because they move more air they're what you want for large motions.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:55.010
But at the same time they are lower thrust and so they're

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.600
not really what you want for hovering a heavy vehicle in the air.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.338
On the other hand, props with a low pitch produce

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.015
more thrust and thus are better for hovering with a heavy load.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:07.114
But they're also less efficient,

00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:11.930
so you use up the battery more quickly and end up being able to fly for less time.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.805
There do exist quadrotors that have

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.300
variable pitch propellers that can do

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.765
low pitch for hover and high pitch for a faster forward motion.

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:25.129
But variable pitch props are a lot more complicated and for our purposes here,

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.383
we'll only be considering fixed pitch propellers,

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:31.875
which is what the majority of quadrotors are flying with.

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.935
So, when you're picking a propeller for a vehicle,

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:36.530
you're really thinking about which flight regime you're going to be in,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.000
or what mission you want your vehicle to accomplish.
