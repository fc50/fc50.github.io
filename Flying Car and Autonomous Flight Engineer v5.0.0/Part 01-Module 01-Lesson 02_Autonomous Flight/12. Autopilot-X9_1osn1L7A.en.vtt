00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
The autopilot is a computer that is responsible for knowing

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.564
just how much thrust to apply to each motor in order to hover,

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:09.214
pitch, roll or yod a vehicle.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.070
The autopilot is responsible for adjusting that thrust in order to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.198
level out once the vehicle is moving at a particular speed,

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:17.829
and then once it gets close to its destination to

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.324
pitch backwards in order to decelerate and stop.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.285
So, we're always moving the vehicle body.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.280
We're pitching it forward and backward,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.006
we're rolling it left and right in order to move from one place to another.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.594
So how can the autopilot, a piece of electronics,

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.618
actually know how to control the speed of

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:35.984
the different propellers in order to achieve the desired result?

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:39.039
To make this happen, the autopilot first needs to know about

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.289
the current thrust vector magnitude and

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.149
direction and then make

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.923
small adjustments to the speed of each of the four spinning motors,

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:49.524
in order to make sure that the intended thrust vector matches what you want.

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:52.000
But it's not possible for the autopilot to figure

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.189
out how fast the vehicle is going or what

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:56.289
the total thrust is without actually

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.594
knowing something first about the attitude of the vehicle.

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:01.304
So, we've arrived at a conundrum.

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:04.299
The autopilot is required to control the vehicle attitude,

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.295
but in order to apply proper control,

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.829
it must first know the attitude of the vehicle.

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:11.238
So, how can the autopilot get this information?

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.000
Well, that requires sensors.
