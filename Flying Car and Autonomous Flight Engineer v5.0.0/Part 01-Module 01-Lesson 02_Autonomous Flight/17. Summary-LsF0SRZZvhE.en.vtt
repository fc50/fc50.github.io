00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
We started off this lesson with a bit of

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.250
a history of flight and in particular, autonomous flight.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.960
Fast-forward to the modern day,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.705
and we're on the cusp of a transformation in technology,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.835
where flying cars will become a reality.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.065
I introduced our test platform for studying autonomous flight, the quadrotor drone.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.650
I covered the basics of what components go into a quadrotor and

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.399
how they function together as an autonomous flying machine.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.169
While the sensors and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.785
mechanical components of a drone are interesting in their own right,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.939
the flight computer is the brain of the whole operation and really,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.085
where the most exciting stuff happens.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:36.774
So, in this program,

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:40.158
we'll be focused primarily on writing software for the flight computer.

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:42.844
We'll look at how to do basic autonomous flight,

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:46.143
3D motion planning, implementing different control loops,

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.635
state estimation, and much more.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.838
That said, we won't lose sight of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.435
the fact that the software you write for your flight computer,

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:57.020
needs to actually function on real hardware at the end of the day.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.240
So, while the projects you complete for

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.940
this program will be carried out in a simulator at first,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.468
we'll also be showing you how to port your project code onto a real vehicle,

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:08.375
should you be inspired to do so.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:13.019
Next up, your first project: event-driven programming for autonomous flight.
