00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
So really, the secret to success in

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.355
controlling a quadrotor is all about having the right attitude.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.815
Get it? Me neither.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.530
The attitude of the quadrotor actually has nothing to do with

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.085
inherent personality but rather with its orientation in space.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:15.870
So now, it's time to think about how to characterize

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.910
the orientation of these things that flies around.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.310
Basically, there are three axes of interest.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.055
If we say that this is the front of the vehicle,

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:26.355
then the pitch angle describes how much is tilted forward or backward.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.790
The roll angle describes how much is tilted to the left or the right.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.285
And the yaw angle how much has turned about the vertical axis.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.430
We'll talk more about more precise ways to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.935
describe the vehicle attitude in future lessons.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.620
But roughly speaking, these three angles, roll, pitch, and yaw,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.750
are commonly referred to as the Euler angles after

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.900
the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler and basically,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.870
what's happening as these rotors spin faster

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.125
or slower and put more or less force on each rotor arm,

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.315
there's a different total amount of thrust and

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.640
torque being produced by the combination of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.460
all four rotors and that acts like a vector that follows the attitude of the vehicle.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.375
So, the name of the game in controlling a quadrotor is spinning each of the rotors

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.235
faster slower in order to aim the thrust vector in one direction or another.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.020
You want to move the vehicle forward?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.375
Aim the thrust vector in that direction.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.565
Want to make the vehicle move faster?

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:19.670
Increase the magnitude and angle of the thrust vector.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.200
Want to stop really fast?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.170
Make the vehicle pitch backwards in a thrust hard.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.200
So, it doesn't take long to realize that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.440
manually controlling the rotation speed of each of the four propellers on

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.435
your quad in order to maintain

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.525
a certain thrust vector or change directions would be really difficult.

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:38.715
This is essentially the same problem

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:42.030
the Wright brothers faced after they got their airplane flying.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.060
It can be just really hard to manually control different kinds of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.555
flying machines and that means we need an autopilot.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:50.740
So, that's what we're going to talk about next.
