00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
To get some intuition about how a quadrotor works,

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.205
let's build one up piece by piece.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.310
To start with, let's take a single rotor and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.609
attach it to a mass representing the body or frame of the vehicle.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.899
This is the simplest possible helicopter.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.719
But what happens when the rotor spins?

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:20.149
In this configuration, the spinning rotor has angular momentum.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.439
And through the conservation of angular momentum,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.740
it will induce a torque on the masses attach to,

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.792
causing it to spin as well in the opposite direction.

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:29.614
Not a great flying machine just yet.

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:34.549
This is why a single rotor helicopter has a tail rotor mounted at 90 degrees to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.500
the main propeller to exert a torque in

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.085
the opposite direction and keep the whole thing from spinning out of control.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:43.730
This is the most common design of manned helicopter vehicles.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.469
But, instead of a tail rotor,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.119
you could introduce another propeller spinning in the opposite direction like this.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.778
Now, you have a dual-prop helicopter,

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.755
also known as counter-rotating propellers.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.429
And the net angular momentum from each of the rotors cancels each other out.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.677
This is an example of a dual propeller helicopter right here.

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:04.099
Now, we could talk about adding a third rotor and

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.009
how you could go about balancing out the torques from three rotors.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.109
But instead, we're going to skip over that in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.370
favor of going right to the symmetric simplicity of the quadrotor.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.260
Quadrotor consists of four rotors attached to a frame usually in an X shape like this.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.700
Rotors that sit opposite from one another on the frame spin in the same direction.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.500
And the two pairs of motors spin in

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.560
opposite directions so that when they're all spinning at the same speed,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.260
the vehicle can hover with a net torque of zero.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.550
So, your basic quad now consists of a frame and four propellers.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.280
You'll also need motors to drive each of the propellers,

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:42.570
an autopilot and flight computer to decide what the motor should do,

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.964
sensors like GPS, an inertial measurement unit or IMU,

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:48.623
a camera to observe your surroundings,

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:50.362
and a battery to power everything.

00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:53.144
And with that, you have a fully functional quadrotor drone.

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:56.129
But the best way to understand how something works is to

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.369
take it apart and investigate each of the components in detail.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.170
So that's what we'll do next.
