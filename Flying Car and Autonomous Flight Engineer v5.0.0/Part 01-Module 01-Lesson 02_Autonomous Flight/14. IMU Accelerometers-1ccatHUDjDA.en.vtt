00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
Gravity provides an acceleration that always tells us which way down is.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.630
And accelerometers can measure that acceleration.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.860
In an IMU, there are three accelerometers at right angles to each other,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.605
so that they can measure the acceleration in the X,

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.605
Y, and the Z directions simultaneously.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.345
If we calibrate the accelerometers,

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:21.350
when we know we're experiencing acceleration only due to gravity,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.580
like when we're sitting on the ground,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.410
then we can use the knowledge of which way gravity is

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.250
pointing as a reference for the gyroscopes to figure out our attitude.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.620
So the accelerometers give us a way to figure out which way

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.650
down is using gravity as a reference, and then,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.655
we can use the gyros to figure out what the attitude of the vehicle must be,

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:41.380
even when we're accelerating in

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.340
other directions and when we no longer have a clean reference to gravity.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.700
The original IMUs used for flight actually had

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.280
spinning tops and springs serving as the gyros and accelerometers.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.565
But now, with advances in technology,

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.460
we're able to make very small IMUs that don't have

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.870
spinning tops for gyroscopes or complicated springs for accelerometers.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.690
In fact, one of the big advances in IMU technology in

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.535
the last 20 years is the advent of micro electro mechanical systems or MEMS,

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:13.450
that basically allow us to put the equivalent of three spinning tops and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.100
three accelerometers onto a tiny chip and put it inside small consumer electronics,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.125
like a drone autopilot or your smartphone.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:24.874
So, now that we have the IMU that allows us to work at our attitude,

00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:27.130
then we can use the autopilot to adjust the thrust on

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.635
the various propellers in order to move in the direction that we want.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.410
But, how do we actually know where we

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.395
are or how we're making progress toward our destination?

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.990
Well, there are many options but the easiest way to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.000
measure position is simply with a GPS receiver.
