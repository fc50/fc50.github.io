00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
Once you have a frame, you need motors.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.900
And most quadrotors use electric motors,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.370
which are very easy to work with.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.825
They don't have complicated carburetors and other mechanisms for mixing fuel and air,

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.440
like the carbon-based fuel engines used on more traditional remote control aircraft.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.975
They're also much safer than combustion engines.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.790
The downside of electric motors,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.395
is they're not very efficient.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:25.570
Battery technology is just not as good at delivering energy as carbon-based fuels,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.060
and the way that electric motors convert

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.075
that energy into flight power is also not as efficient.

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.610
But, electric motors are easy to work with,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.302
and they are what you generally find in most quadrotors.

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:40.425
More specifically, most qudrotors, like this,

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:44.844
use brushless motors, which operate by oscillating magnetic field.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.990
That oscillation cause the magnets inside the motor to spin the motor shaft.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.570
These motors are called brushless because of the fact that there's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.095
no contact between the control mechanism and the motor shaft,

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.530
in contrast to more traditional brushed motors,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.765
where the drive and the shaft are in contact via brushes.

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:04.955
This lack of contact allows brushless motors to spin faster and more efficiently.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.975
As far as the discussion of motors goes, I'm going to leave it at that.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:12.235
But check out the links below to learn more about brushed versus brushless motors.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:14.965
And that takes us to the next component of the quadrotor,

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:18.415
which is called the electronic speed controller, or ESC.

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:23.065
Each of the four ESCs in your quadrotor receives a signal from the autopilot saying,

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:26.215
spin that particular motor at a particular rpm.

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:29.635
And then the ESC oscillates the magnetic field at the appropriate rate,

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.135
in order to spin the motor.

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:33.085
So now you've got your motor's spinning,

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.575
and the whole point is for your motors to spin your propellers.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.940
So, up next, propellers.
