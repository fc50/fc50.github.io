00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.278
So, we said that the autopilot can control

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:04.932
the attitude of a quadrotor by controlling the motors,

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:07.544
but in order to know what thrust to apply to each motor,

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:10.515
it must first know the attitude of the vehicle as well.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.570
Thankfully, there is a solution.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
By far and away, the most common sensor the drones used for sensing

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
their attitude is what's known as an inertial measurement unit or IMU.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.728
Have you ever wondered what kind of magic allows your phone to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.039
understand which way you're holding

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.644
the screen or what direction you're pointing the camera?

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:32.460
That magic in your phone is an IMU inside.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.825
So, the IMU is a bit of a complicated device.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.780
Most IMUs consists of three gyroscopes and three accelerometers.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.865
Let's first talk about the gyros.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:45.270
You could think of a gyroscope like a spinning top.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.075
In fact, here's a gyroscope right here.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:53.515
Let's spin it up and mount in on our quadrotor.

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:57.023
You have a gyroscope inside a drone,

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.915
and the drone changes its attitude.

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:00.615
In this case, it turns its role of pitch.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.905
The gyroscope maintains its orientation.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.760
So, you can directly measure how much the drone has changed

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.793
its attitude relative to the gyro inside.

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:12.975
And if you have three of them spinning inside the vehicle at right angles to each other,

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:15.329
then you can measure how much the vehicle is moving

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:17.943
and rotating in each of those three directions.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.028
So, gyroscopes are like spinning tops and they maintain

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.704
their orientation to the world over short periods of time slowly drifting.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:27.699
So, they can serve as a reference over short periods of time.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.490
The gyros inside the IMU in your drone

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.814
can tell you how the vehicles attitude is changing,

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:33.809
but we'd like to know exactly how it is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.299
changing relative to some reference coordinate frame.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.000
To do that, we need to have accelerometers in our IMU as well.
