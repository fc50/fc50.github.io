00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.758
In this lesson, I'm going to start off by giving you a little bit of

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:06.849
history and the context around autonomous flying robots.

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.178
This program is all about flying cars which present their own set of challenges,

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:14.200
but autonomous flying machines are not necessarily a new thing.

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.838
In fact, if you've ever been on an airplane,

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.523
you've traveled inside of an autonomous flying robot.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.359
So, I'll talk a little bit about the history of

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.679
flight and where we're at today on the cusp of a transportation revolution.

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:30.279
After that, I'll introduce the experimental platform you'll be

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.225
working with and the projects for this program, the quadrotor drone.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:38.030
I'll go over the main components of the quadrotor and how each needs to be

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.386
selected considering the task or mission you want your drone to do.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:47.554
With this bit of background on autonomous flight and basic knowledge about quadrotors,

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.450
you'll be ready to move on to the next lesson where

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.230
you'll write code to fly autonomously in a simulator.
