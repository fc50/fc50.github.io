00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.259
So, now we are ready to write the code that you

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.879
would actually put in a drone to fly a real physical drone.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.789
We're going to start a bit with

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.375
the proto-typing setup where we're going to do code in Python,

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.640
and we have a simulation of a join that you can then control.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.359
You should start not just writing the code but also kind

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.515
of tuning the various gains of the controller because it's actually do matter a lot.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:27.565
Then, we're going to import this code from Python to C plus plus

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:33.000
which is the preferred systems language because it's much more predictable in execution.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.814
In C plus plus, you can do a few exercises.

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:37.609
We're going to tighten the dynamics of

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.799
your drone a little bit to make it even harder to control.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you get a flavor for how hard it actually is to make a drone fly.
