00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
At this point, we've actually covered all the underlying physics of

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.910
quadrotor flight or at least the physics that we'll be modeling.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.080
You've seen how a propeller generates a thrust and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.480
a yaw inducing reaction moment that are

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.770
both proportional to the square of the rotation rate.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.855
You've also seen how gravity,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.460
along with these thrusts,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
influenced the translational acceleration of the vehicle.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.260
And you've also seen how these thrusts produce

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.460
torques which can cause the quadrotor to pitch and roll.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.513
And really, that's about it for the physics that we really need to consider for now.

00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:43.114
Now, it's time to write

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:48.885
the advanced state method for a controlled drone that flies in two dimensions.

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:51.030
Writing this method will require you to put

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.935
together everything you've learned in this lesson.

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.315
We'll be providing a solution as well,

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:00.000
but try your best to solve this on your own.
