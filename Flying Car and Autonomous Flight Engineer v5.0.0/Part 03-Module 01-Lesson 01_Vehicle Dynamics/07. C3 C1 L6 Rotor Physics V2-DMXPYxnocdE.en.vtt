00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
The rotors that spin clockwise,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.209
introduce a counterclockwise moment, and vice versa.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.294
When the clockwise rotors are spinning faster than the counterclockwise ones,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:16.335
then the counterclockwise moment produced by those clockwise rotors dominates,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.160
and the vehicle will yar in the counterclockwise direction.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.545
But at what rate will it yaw?

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:28.574
What are the magnitudes of the moments and forces that the spinning rotors produce?

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:31.590
We use the lowercase Greek letter, omega,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.520
to represent the rotation rate of a rotor,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.785
and this rate is measured in units of Radians per second.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.214
So, when omega is two pi,

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.515
the rotor is doing one rotation per second.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:49.495
It turns out, that when a rotor spins for the rotation rate of omega,

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:55.824
the thrust produced and the induced moment are both proportional to the omega squared.

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.705
The constant of proportionality,

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:01.614
we call k sub f for force,

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:03.895
and k sub m for moment.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:09.189
The actual value of these constants depends on the size and shape of the plates,

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.185
the specific motors used,

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:15.250
as well as the density of the surrounding air they operate in.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.129
In practice, we usually obtain these values empirically.
