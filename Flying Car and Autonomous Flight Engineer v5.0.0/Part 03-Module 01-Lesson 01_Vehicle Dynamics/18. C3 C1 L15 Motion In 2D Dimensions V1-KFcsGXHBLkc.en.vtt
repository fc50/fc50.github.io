00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.035
So far, you've written code to update

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.410
the state of a vehicle for two different situations.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.970
First, for a controlled copter which moved only in the set direction,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.119
and second, for an uncontrolled vehicle free falling in two dimensions.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.795
And in both cases,

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:21.265
the forces were only in the vertical direction.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:25.080
In both situations, you had gravity pointing down,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.450
and in the first situation,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.665
you also had thrust,

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:31.485
but that always pointed upwards for the 1-D case.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:35.034
This made it easy to figure out the net force on the vehicle.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:38.300
When the vehicle is allowed to pitch overall,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.771
and actually turn on its rotors,

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.524
then we have to handle forces at weird angles like this.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:46.460
In the next two sections,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.877
I will show you how you can use trigonometry to decompose forces in two dimensions,

00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:56.123
and then I will also show you an equation for calculating torques,

00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:00.000
which you will need to use in calculating pitch and roll in a quadrotor.
