00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.474
Now, we'd like to describe the full two-dimensional motion of the vehicle.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:09.649
We've discussed how a rotor that's turning clockwise,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.580
will introduce a counter-clockwise moment about the axis of rotation.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.509
And we call this reaction moment,

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.980
because it's a rotational moment that is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.725
an opposite reaction to some other rotational motion.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:27.530
But reaction moments only explain yaw.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.520
What about pitch and roll?

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.412
When the left rotors produce more stress than the right rotors,

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:42.034
the quad rotor will experience a clockwise acceleration.

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:45.125
And that's because the rotors on the left side,

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.439
produce a clockwise moment which is bigger than

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.820
the counter-clockwise moment produced by the rotors on the right side.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.670
The moment that causes this rotation is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.520
slightly different than the reaction moment that causes yaw.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.540
This torque comes from a force that acts perpendicular to the axis of rotation,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.635
at some distance from the center of the vehicle.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.850
And the magnitude of this torque,

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:16.089
is found by multiplying this perpendicular distance by that force.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.765
The example torque calculations below this video,

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.180
should make this calculation a little more clear.
