00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.205
Just like how unbalanced forces cause translational acceleration,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:09.285
unbalanced moments cause rotational acceleration.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.669
And the equation that relates these quantities looks like this,

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.144
torque is equal to I times alpha.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:22.085
This is the equation you might see in an introductory physics class.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:26.089
Here, torque is the net torque around a given axis.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.024
And remember, I'm using the word torque interchangeably with moment.

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:34.527
Alpha is the angular acceleration about the same axis,

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.405
so it tells me how fast my rotational speed is changing.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.060
The units for alpha are radians per second squared.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.700
And this I is a little more interesting.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.594
It's a quantity called Moment of Inertia.

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:50.304
And it's a measure of how hard it is to change

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.560
an object's rotational velocity about a particular axis.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.925
Remember that a quadrotor can roll around its x-axis,

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.129
pitch around its y-axis,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.254
and yaw around its z-axis.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:09.739
And in general, the moment of inertia can be different for each of these axes.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:11.030
We will see later,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.855
that to describe the three-dimensional quadrotor motion,

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:17.495
the moment of inertia will be a three by three matrix,

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.015
and torque and alpha are vectors.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:22.075
For the purposes of this lesson,

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:25.954
we'll only be thinking about one axis of rotation at a time.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:27.980
For our monorotor example,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.289
we are only considering yaw about the z-axis,

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.808
so we only need to pay attention to Iz,

00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:36.500
and alpha and the torque are scalar values.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.745
In the world of quadrotor dynamics,

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:42.255
people tended to use the word moment over torque.

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:46.739
And we usually use the Greek letter psi to represent yaw.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.954
So, another way to write this torque equation is like this,

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:55.674
Mz is equal to Iz times psi double dot.

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.051
And this is just another way of saying,

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:04.020
that a moment about the z-axis will cause an acceleration in the psi coordinate.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:05.780
Now, let's try applying this,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.215
first by answering a few questions,

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:11.469
and then by programming up a more general solution.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.097
In the next few segments,

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:16.670
the vehicle we will be discussing is a co-axial helicopter,

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.804
which is just a body with two rotors on top of each other.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:23.580
These rotors both produce upward thrusts,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000
but they do so by spinning in opposite directions.
