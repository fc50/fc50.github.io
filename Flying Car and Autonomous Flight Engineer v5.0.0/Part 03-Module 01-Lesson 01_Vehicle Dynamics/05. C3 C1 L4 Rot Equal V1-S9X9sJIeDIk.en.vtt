00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.544
If the weight vector of a monorotor is 100 newtons down,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:06.314
then if it's hovering,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.390
the thrust must be 100 newtons up.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.429
To calculate the mass of this mono rotor we have to remember that weight is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.054
a product of mass and the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:26.681
So 100 divided by 9.81 would give a mass of about 10.2 kilograms,

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.429
which means this is a pretty big quadrotor.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.949
The last question was a little tricky,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.144
and was really meant to get you thinking.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:40.865
But actually, it's impossible for a monorotor to sit truly motionless in the sky.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:46.565
And that's because a monorotor can never be in what's called rotational equilibrium.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:52.920
At this point, I'd like to show you a video of what an actual monorotor can look like.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.679
As you watch, notice the rotation of the monorotor's body.
