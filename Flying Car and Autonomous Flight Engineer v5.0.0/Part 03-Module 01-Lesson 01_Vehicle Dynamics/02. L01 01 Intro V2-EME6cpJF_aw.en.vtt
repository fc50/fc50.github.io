00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to the first lesson of controls.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.849
This lesson is called Vehicle Dynamics.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.334
My name is Angela Schoellig and I will be your instructor for this course.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:11.490
And my name is Andy Brown and I'll be

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.115
popping in occasionally to explain a concept or two,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.469
but mostly I'll be helping you as you work through

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.003
the programming exercises that you'll encounter throughout this course.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:24.269
So, Angela, can you explain what do we mean when we talk about vehicle dynamics?

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.864
Well, dynamics is concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces.

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.205
So for our purposes,

00:00:31.205 --> 00:00:34.769
vehicle dynamics means understanding how the rotation of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.900
the drone's four propellers creates

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.429
forces and how these forces generate motion of the vehicle.

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.015
And in this lesson,

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.100
you'll be learning how to model these forces

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
mathematically in Python and then you'll use those models

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.710
to advance the current state of the vehicle into

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.380
the future to actually predict the motion of flying vehicles.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.695
Exactly, and there are plenty of reasons why we need to build these models.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:00:59.579
But from a control standpoint,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.820
having a good dynamic model of the vehicle allows us to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.379
intelligently influences the output of the vehicle by properly setting the inputs.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:13.189
And what do we mean when we talk about inputs and outputs for something like a drone?

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.536
Right. So for a drone,

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:16.880
the input would be the rotation rates of

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:21.619
the four propellers and the output would be the resulting motion of the vehicle.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.090
Sounds good. Let's get started.
