00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.714
At this point, you have some intuitive understanding of how the rotation rates of

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:12.044
four propellers can lead to four quantities that we are actually most interested in.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.714
The collective upwards thrust,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.684
the total moment about the x axis,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.890
which causes the vehicle to roll,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.410
the total moment about the y axis,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.725
which causes the vehicle to pitch,

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:30.745
and the total reaction moment about the set axis which causes the vehicle to yaw.

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.759
When we analyze the dynamics of a vehicle with

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:38.335
a side-by-side rotor configuration that moves in two-dimensions,

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:42.609
we only need to consider the first two quantities.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.070
As you'll see in the next segment,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.715
it's possible to write code that directly translates

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:53.005
the rotation rates of the two motors into a collective thrust,

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.660
and a moment about the x axis.
