00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
The monorotor you just saw use

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.975
some pretty clever control logic to do some remarkable things,

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.080
but the thing I want you to focus on is the rotation of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.235
the monorotor body and where that rotation comes from.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.520
In addition to causing a thrust force,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.935
a rotating propeller also introduces what's called a "moment" or "torque."

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.550
So a rotor that's spinning clockwise will produce

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.765
a moment that causes the body to spin counterclockwise.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.700
When we design flying aircraft,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.585
we generally don't want the spinning behavior.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.620
If you look at commercially available drones,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.495
you'll notice they almost always have an even number of rotors.

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:46.810
One main reason for this is because it gives us

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.415
an easy way to get rid of this unwanted rotation of the vehicle body.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:53.114
So with the quadrotor,

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.125
you'll actually have two different types of rotor plates.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.605
One type is meant to provide upward thrust when spinning

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:02.470
clockwise and the other type is meant to

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.785
provide upward thrust when spinning counterclockwise.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:09.790
We then place these propellers onto the quadrotor in a configuration

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.059
where adjacent rotors always spin in the opposite directions.

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.850
Then, if we want zero rotation or yaw,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.050
we just make sure all the rotors are spinning at the same rate

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.775
so that clockwise torques exactly balance counterclockwise torques.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.216
If we decide we do want the vehicle to yaw,

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:31.940
then we adjust the rotational rates so that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.470
the clockwise rotors are spinning faster or slower than the counterclockwise ones.
