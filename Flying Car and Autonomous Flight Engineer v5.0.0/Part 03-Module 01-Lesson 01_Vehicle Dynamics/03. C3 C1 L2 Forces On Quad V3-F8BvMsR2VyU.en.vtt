00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
To understand the dynamics that is the motion of a quadrotor,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.940
we need to understand the forces that act on it.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.830
In case it's been a while since you've taken a physics class,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.645
we are going to do a pretty quick review of the basic physics in this lesson.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:21.210
A force is just a push or a pull on an object.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.610
In order to support this quadrotor,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.000
my arms are exerting a force upwards,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.890
which is equal in size to the force that gravity exerts downwards.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.035
In flight, a quadrotor is not supported by anyone's arms.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.110
Instead, a quadrotor supports itself with

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.240
this thrust force generated by its rotors as they spin through the air.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.900
In fact, these two forces, gravity and thrust,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.225
are the only two types of forces that

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:52.150
we will be thinking about or modeling in this course.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.760
In reality, there's at least one more force which affects the motion of a quadrotor,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.105
and that is air resistance or drag.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:07.430
Drag is a friction force caused by the motion of a body through a fluid such as air.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.550
For example, the quadrotor experiences a drag force because

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.065
of the difference in velocity between the vehicle body and the air.

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:20.385
And there's even drag related to each propeller's individual motion.

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:26.220
In practice, we usually treat drag as a disturbance when designing quadrotor controllers,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150
and don't model it explicitly as the effects are relatively small at

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.925
lower vehicle and wind speeds and

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.004
because it's difficult to identify the correct drag model.

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.795
So let's focus on these two forces,

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:42.120
the force from gravity or weight,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.585
and the forces from each of the rotors, thrust.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.205
As is all forces,

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:51.285
the size of these forces is measured in a unit called newton.

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:53.580
Force is a vector,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.415
and that means that when we analyze a force,

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.310
we need to know both the size or magnitude of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.450
that force as well as the direction that force points.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.810
For gravity, the force always points straight downwards toward the center of the earth.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.870
And the strength of the force is given by M times G where M is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.970
the mass of the quadrotor and G is the acceleration due to gravity,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
which is about 9.81 meters per second square.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.035
This is the rate at which an object will

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:30.545
accelerate downwards when it's dropped here on Earth.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:34.880
The strengths of the thrust vector depends on the size and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.095
shape of the rotor's plates and on how fast they are spinning.

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.500
And the direction of a rotor's thrust vector is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.300
always perpendicular to the plane that the rotor is spinning in.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.860
When we control a quadrotor,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.150
all we actually get is to control the magnitude of these four thrust vectors.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.929
That's it.

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.795
What's really amazing is that by properly controlling the size of these four thrusts,

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:04.930
we can get quadrotors to do amazing things.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.548
We can tell it where to go,

00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:13.600
how fast to get there and can even commanded it to perform amazing fleets of agility.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.390
The details of how this control

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.320
works is something you will learn over the course of this lesson,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.930
but the intuition is something you might already have a sense for.
