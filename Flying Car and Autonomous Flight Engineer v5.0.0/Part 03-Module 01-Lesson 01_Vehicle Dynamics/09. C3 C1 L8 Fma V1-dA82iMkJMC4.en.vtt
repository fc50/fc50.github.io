00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.576
Unbalanced forces cause acceleration.

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:06.930
When an object experiences an unbalanced force,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.690
it accelerates in the direction of the net force.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.170
So if thrust is bigger than weight,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.775
there will be an upwards acceleration.

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:20.400
A mathematical relationship between force and acceleration is this,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.610
F equals mass M times acceleration A.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.190
The F in this equation,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.415
is the net force on whatever object we're talking about,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.450
and the acceleration is measured in an inertial frame.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.990
That is, a reference frame that is not accelerating,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.320
like the world frame introduced earlier.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.950
In general, F and A are vectors and have magnitude and direction.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.105
But these vectors can be analyzed on a pure direction basis.

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:51.849
So, if we look in the vertical direction,

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:57.385
then the set component of force will cause an acceleration in the set direction.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:01.320
Since acceleration is the second derivative of position,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.330
we can say F sub Z is equal to M times Z double dot.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.890
So, if a monorotor with a mass of two kilograms has these forces acting on it,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.985
then the net force would be 23.6 minus 19.6, or 4 newtons.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:25.000
And this would cause an acceleration of two meters per second squared for this vehicle.
