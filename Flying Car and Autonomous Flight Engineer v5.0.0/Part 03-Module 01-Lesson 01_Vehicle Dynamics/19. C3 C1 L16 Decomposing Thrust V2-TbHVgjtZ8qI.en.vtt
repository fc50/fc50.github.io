00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Here, we have a vehicle inclined at some angle phi.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.140
And note, when I say it's inclined at some angle,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.894
I'm saying that the vehicle is inclined with respect to the world reference frame.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.089
And the reference frame has a z-axis which points

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.660
downwards and a y-axis that points to the right.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.600
And that means that the thrust vector makes

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.865
an angle with the vertical axis of the world frame.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.169
Now, we want to decompose this vector into

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.420
vertical and horizontal components in

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.065
the directions of the coordinate axis of our world frame.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:37.359
That will look like this.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.075
Now, since this is a right angle,

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.880
we can use the tools of trigonometry to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.515
solve for the horizontal and the vertical components of the thrust.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.484
The way we do that is by writing out

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:55.810
trigonometric relationships and then solving for what we don't know.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.679
So, for example, I know that the sine of phi is equal to

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.795
the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse,

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:09.465
which in this case, it's the horizontal component of force divided by the total force.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.770
We can solve this equation to find that the horizontal component of

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:19.655
thrust is just the total thrust times the sine of the angle phi.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:24.879
We can apply similar reasoning to find that the vertical component of

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:29.799
thrust is just the total thrust times the cosine of phi.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.479
It's worth noting that we worked exclusively in the world frame here.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.990
And generally, we can figure out this dynamics in

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:41.485
two dimension without having to work in the body frame,

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:46.870
which, remember, is the coordinate frame that's fixed to the vehicle body.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.680
When we get to three-dimensional dynamics in the fourth lesson,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.920
that will no longer be the case.
