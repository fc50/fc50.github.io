00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.384
So far, we've discussed how a spinning rotor produces thrust and moments.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:07.574
We've also discussed equilibrium,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.134
where forces and moments all balance each other out and sum to zero.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:16.379
Now, it's time to talk about what happens when this is not the case.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.509
Before we get into the math,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.700
it's worth thinking about the intuition for what happens when forces do not balance.
