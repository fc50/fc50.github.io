00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
So now on to one of my favorite lessons in this nunnery program.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.580
It's on control. For one,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.365
I'm actually a control freak.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.180
But secondly, controls is

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.310
a fascinating area that you actually make a vehicle physically move.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.410
Let me explain to you what's missing.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.660
So far, we've assumed that we can build a vehicles from node

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.070
to node along the graph and they completely ignored the physics of the vehicle,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.175
how it actually gets there, what's going to happen?

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.720
Controls concerned itself with the question,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.025
given all these paths,

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:33.020
how can we actually activate

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.860
these various rotors to get the desired effect in a physical space,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.420
in a continuous space.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.410
To do this, we have to understand physics.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.320
It's called vehicle dynamics.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.495
We have to understand how our vehicle works,

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:50.550
and how spinning up little engines affects the state of the vehicle.
