00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.598
By the end of this course,

00:00:01.598 --> 00:00:03.322
you will understand, in detail,

00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:06.169
how to command these force thrust vectors to make a quadrotor

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.132
to do all sorts of amazing things.

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:11.934
But before we get into the full three-dimensional case,

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:14.005
it will be helpful to start simple,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.339
and then add complexity.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.384
So with that in mind,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.215
let's start very simple.

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.410
Instead of thinking how a quadrotor moves,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.847
let's first think about how a monorotor hovers.

00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:30.487
In this lesson, and some of the lessons that follow,

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:32.670
you'll notice that we occasionally work with

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.770
different vehicle models to highlight different aspects of the underlying physics.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.288
Sometimes we'll work with a full quadrotor moving in three dimensions,

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:47.919
but other times we will work with a simpler vehicle which moves in fewer dimensions.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.304
The monorotor, as the name implies,

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:52.104
has only one rotor,

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:55.454
which means there's only one thrust vector to think about.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.173
And when a monorotor is hovering,

00:00:58.173 --> 00:01:01.719
it's in a state called translational equilibrium.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.959
When an object is in translational equilibrium,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.269
it means it's not experiencing any translational acceleration.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.060
A translation is any non-rotational motion.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.805
So, zero translational acceleration,

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:20.479
just means an object isn't accelerating towards the left or right,

00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:23.489
or up or down, or forward or backward.

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.875
The only way an object can be in translational equilibrium,

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.284
is if the net force on the object is zero.

00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:37.813
And this means that any upwards force is balanced by an equal downwards force,

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:42.519
and likewise, for right left and forward back forces.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.219
If the weight of a hovering monorotor like this one

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.307
results in a force that is equal to 100 Newtons down,

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:55.000
what can we say about the total thrust provided by its one rotor.
