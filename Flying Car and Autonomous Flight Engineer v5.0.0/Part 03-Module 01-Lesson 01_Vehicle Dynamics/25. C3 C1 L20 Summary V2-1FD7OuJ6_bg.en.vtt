00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
One way of thinking about the controller problem is this.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.459
Given a desire trajectory,

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.669
find the continuous sequence of

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.875
propeller rotation rates that will cause the drone to fly along that trajectory.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:18.734
A trajectory is a sequence of 3D positions and yaw,

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:23.629
and associated times at which you want to be at that position and yaw.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:28.884
In this lesson, you've worked on a similar but reversed version of the problem.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:35.795
In fact, the problem you know how to solve now is best described by this.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:39.575
Given a continuous sequence of propeller rotation rates,

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:43.210
predict the trajectory that the drone will fly.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.835
And you solve this for the 2D case when you implemented the advanced state function.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:51.600
And solving this problem isn't trivial.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.719
Starting with nothing but an ability to set

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.454
the rotational rates of the propellers, you had to do,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:04.799
one, know how those rotational rates lead to thrusts and moments about the X,

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.159
Y and Z body axis.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.219
Two, know how thrusts and moments affect the acceleration and rotation of the vehicle.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.569
And three, know how accelerations when

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.484
integrated twice affect the actual position and orientation of the vehicle.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.030
And then, on top of that,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.112
you had to implement all of that in code. Good job.

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:31.609
In the next lesson,

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.530
you'll learn how to use something called a PID controller to go the other way,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.590
and convert a desire trajectory into a continuous sequence of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.000
rotor commands that actually control a drone to track the target trajectory.
