00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
The function you just worked with is responsible for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.450
advancing the state of the vehicle by dt seconds.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.460
And for uncontrolled vehicle,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.145
the only information we need to be able to do that,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.160
is the current state of the vehicle,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.720
which is captured in this reference to self,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.910
and that's pretty amazing.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.413
Now, the important thing I want you to notice about this code,

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:23.010
are these few lines.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.985
Even so, we are working with a very simple system here,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:28.679
these lines of code capture

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.739
much more widely useful mathematical strategy for

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.417
solving these sorts of state update problems.

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:38.259
And that strategy involves three steps.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.429
Step number one, we figure out what the accelerations

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.854
and rotational acceleration of the system will be at the current instant.

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.944
For a quadrotor whose orders aren't spinning,

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.244
the acceleration just comes from gravity,

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:55.494
which is 9.81 meters per second squared.

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:59.320
Step two, we use this acceleration to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.549
update the associated velocities or rates of change.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.340
Step number three, we use the velocity to update the associated position.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.855
Note, how similar step two and three look.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.535
That's because mathematically, we are doing the same thing.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.304
We're accumulating change by calculating,

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:23.685
well really we are numerically approximating the integral.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:27.299
And because we need to integrate twice to figure

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.019
out how the acceleration ultimately influences the motion,

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:34.394
this is what's known as a second order system,

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.075
or a double integrator.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:39.990
Mathematically, the reason this is a second order system,

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.125
is because the equations that govern how the system

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:47.000
evolves with time, includes second derivatives.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.370
And this equation for a vehicle moving in the vertical directions just

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.305
says that forces directly influenced the second derivative of position.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:00.763
And since we can generally figure out what the forces will be on the quadrotor,

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:04.135
you can generally figure out what the accelerations will be.

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:08.860
And then it's just a matter of integrating twice to go from acceleration,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.050
to velocity, to position.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.090
An important consequence of this,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.150
is that we need to keep track of both the position,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.069
and the velocity of the vehicle.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.829
But nothing more, if we want to be able to keep

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.450
advancing the state of the vehicle forward by dt.
