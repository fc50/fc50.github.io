00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
Now that we can follow curved orbits with a lateral directional controller,

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.244
we can build a similar cascaded controller for straight line flights.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.330
This controller will be responsible for getting

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.990
the vehicle to the correct altitude and their speed,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.000
by controlling the elevator deflection and the thrust.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.495
Before we build the longitudinal controller,

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:19.679
notice that we have some redundancy here,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.989
since the pitch and the throttle could each

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.964
have an effect on the vehicles altitude and their speed.

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.774
To handle the redundancy,

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:30.390
we typically divide longitudinal flight into four zones.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.289
In the takeoff zone, we want to climb at a specific pitch angle as quickly as possible.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.030
So, we fly at full throttle and simply

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.070
use the elevators to keep our pitch at the desired angle,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.405
how do we know what the pitch angle at takeoff is supposed to be?

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.590
It depends on properties of the vehicle,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.710
things like the tail clarence which constrains

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.304
how much the vehicle can pitch, near the ground.

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:54.545
The takeoff angle also depends on what's around the runway.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:58.900
The vehicle needs to be pitched enough to clear nearby buildings and trees.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.835
Once airborne, we enter the climb zone,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.950
here our goal is to climb to the target altitude as quickly as possible.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.144
We still keep the full throttle here,

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:10.644
but now we use our pitch to control the air speed.

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:12.295
For going forward too fast,

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:14.135
we can pitch up and climb faster,

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:15.670
and if we're going too slow,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.769
we can pitch down to avoid stall.

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:20.149
Once we get close to our desired height,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.825
we're in the altitude hold zone.

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.740
In this regime, we regulate

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.530
our altitude with our pitch and our air speed with a throttle.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.665
This zone is where we'll spend the majority of our flight time.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.625
When the target altitude is well below the vehicle altitude,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.409
we're in the descent zone.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.234
This is similar to the climb zone,

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:40.269
except now we set the throttle to zero and use the pitch to control the air speed.

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:45.390
Flying in these four zones requires four control loops: pitch attitude hold,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.245
altitude hold using pitch,

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:48.995
airspeed hold using pitch,

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:51.250
and airspeed hold using throttle.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.400
Let's look at each of these loops a little more closely.
