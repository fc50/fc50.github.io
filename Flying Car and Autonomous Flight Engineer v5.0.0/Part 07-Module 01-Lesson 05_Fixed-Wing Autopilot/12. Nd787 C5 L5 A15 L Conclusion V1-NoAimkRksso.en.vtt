00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
At this point, you're ready for the final project.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.959
In this project, you'll use what you've learned about fixed-wing dynamics and control,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.769
to implement an autopilot for a fixed-wing vehicle.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.869
This autopilot will issue commands to the propulsion system and control surfaces,

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.449
to control a fixed-wing vehicle as it navigates from trim state to trim state.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.454
The project is broken into scenarios which are meant to help you individually

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:27.070
isolate and tune all of the control loops that you learned about in this lesson.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.780
You don't necessarily need to go through these scenarios in order,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.420
but you'll probably find it easier to converge on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.280
a working set of control parameters if you do. Good luck.
