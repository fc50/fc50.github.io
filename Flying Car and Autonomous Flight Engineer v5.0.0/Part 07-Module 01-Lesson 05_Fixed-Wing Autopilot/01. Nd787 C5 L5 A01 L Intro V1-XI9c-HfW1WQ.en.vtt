00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome back. You've learned about the dynamics that govern fixed-wing flight,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.964
and now it's time to talk about how we actually control a fixed-wing vehicle.

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:10.650
There are many ways to handle fixed-wing control,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.410
but PID controller is one effective approach,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.045
and it's the approach that we're going to take in this lesson.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.630
A lot of what you see in this lesson should look

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.660
familiar but we're going to discuss a few new concepts,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.905
and practical considerations as well.

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.730
After this lesson, you will be able to implement

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.800
your own autopilot to control a fixed-wing vehicle.
