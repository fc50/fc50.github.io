00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
We've spent a lot of time working out the dynamic model of a fixed-wing aircraft,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:05.879
and we have an understanding of

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.824
the different dynamic modes that the vehicle will exhibit.

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:11.729
But how do we actually put all this together to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.705
get our flying car to follow a particular trajectory?

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:17.489
The dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle mean,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.394
that there are lots of plans that we just can't follow.

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:22.469
The vehicle obviously can't go backwards,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.539
but it also use a stall speed and it has

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.250
a maximum bank angle that limits our turning radius to some minimum.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.519
To simplify our planning problem and also simplify the control problem,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.070
we're going to define a set of trim states that we can be

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.740
in and the goal of the autopilot is to move us from

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.310
trim state to trim state and keep us in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.105
those trim states when the vehicle is perturbed by things like wind gusts.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:48.484
These trim states are generally straight-line paths or curved orbits.

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.875
By restricting our trajectory to these states,

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.700
we're basically restricting ourselves to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.690
either longitudinal dynamic modes or we're in level flight climbing or

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.659
descending or lateral directional flight where

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.129
we're doing a coordinated turn in one direction or another.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.040
Can the vehicle do more things than that?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.660
Of course, but more sophisticated maneuvers are a lot

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.239
harder to both plant and control so we're going to leave those for another day.
