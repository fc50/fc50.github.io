00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
We're going to separate the control problem into

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.960
two separate autopilots: the lateral directional autopilot,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.679
and the longitudinal autopilot.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.544
Let's start with the lateral directional autopilot.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.905
The lateral directional autopilot has two jobs: maintain the desired heading,

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:16.739
and keep sideslip to a minimum.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.559
Each of these responsibilities is handled through its own controller.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.439
The course controller maintains heading by controlling the ailerons.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.109
So, it takes a commanded heading angle as input,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.884
and produces an aileron command as output,

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:33.175
and this controller is actually a nested controller.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:37.098
The outer loop uses the heading to generate a target roll angle,

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:41.244
and the inner loop uses the error enroll angle to command the ailerons.

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:43.864
This inner loop will be a PD controller.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.490
Why don't we have an integral term in this inner loop?

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.118
Remember that the integrator's job is to handle any modeling errors,

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:53.329
but it can take some time for the integrator to get to the right value,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.329
which limits how quickly the inner loop can respond.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.850
We're going to try and get the inner loop's model of

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.810
the vehicle dynamics as accurate as possible to avoid needing an I term,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.960
which will make the inner loop more responsive to disturbances.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.959
Of course, if we have a more responsive inner loop,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.479
we also want to make sure it doesn't over react to disturbances,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.930
so we definitely want a D term to damp this loop.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.030
This outer loop will be a PI controller.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.855
Here is where we can use an I term to handle any errors in our model,

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:25.160
and because it'll be a much slower loop,

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.140
we don't need to damp it with a D term.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.670
Responsiveness isn't as much an issue here.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
The sideslip controller controls the sideslip angle with the rudder.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.384
Generally, the target sideslip angle will be zero,

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:39.510
but there are some situations where that won't be the case.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.984
This controller will be a PI controller.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.510
Together, these three controllers,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.969
each with two tunable parameters will be

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.670
enough to control the lateral directional motion of the vehicle.
