00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
The controller you'll implement for the final project will consist of many control loops,

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.914
some of these will be nested inside other loops while others will not.

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:10.429
Some will have integral terms, some won't.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.199
Some will have derivative terms and others will not.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.119
Before we dive into the details of

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.559
the fixed-wing control architecture that you'll be implementing in the final project,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:24.029
I'd like to discuss a few of the design considerations behind this architecture.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.470
We're going to use the same kind of PID loops you saw in the control module,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.599
but not every loop is going to look the same,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.550
and it's important to understand how we're

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.924
making the design decisions of our controllers.

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:38.279
Firstly, we'll get simplicity of design by decoupling

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.140
the longitudinal and lateral control with two separate controllers.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.359
When we get to longitudinal control,

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.240
we'll use this decoupling strategy again by defining

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.039
separate controllers for separate longitudinal flight regimes.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.619
Secondly, every loop will have a proportional term,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.445
but not all will have derivative terms and not all will have integral terms.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.009
We'll also want much more responsive control

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.229
on some of the state variables than on others.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.765
We always want the P term since that's the term that

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.780
actually steers the system towards the desired value.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.049
Integral terms are good to have on the outermost loop of

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.560
a control system because they can account for any errors in our model,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.945
and they ensure that the system eventually reaches the target state.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:22.524
But I terms also add instability to the system.

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.600
So, in general, we want to avoid adding I terms to

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.390
inner loop controllers where instability can cause serious problems.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.430
Differential terms damp out

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.020
oscillations and prevent overshoot in systems that have a lot of inertia,

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.084
but not much inherent damping.

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:40.539
As an example, we'll use a D term in the controller that sets

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.805
the elevator deflection based on error and pitch because without this term,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.705
we'd get more oscillations.

00:01:46.704 --> 00:01:49.000
By being careful with how we design

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.540
our control loops and what terms we include in each loop,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.600
we can make the job of tuning a lot easier.
