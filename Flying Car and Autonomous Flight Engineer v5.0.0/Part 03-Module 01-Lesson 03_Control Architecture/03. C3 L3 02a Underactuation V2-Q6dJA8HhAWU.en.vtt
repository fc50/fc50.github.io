00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
In the previous lesson,

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:05.054
the vehicle could only move up and down.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:06.765
Another way of saying this,

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:10.349
is that the vehicle only had one degree of freedom.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.835
Likewise, the vehicle could be controlled through one control variable,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.609
the total thrust. And this worked fine.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.829
One controllable variable, thrust,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.014
could control one degree of freedom, the z position.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:29.670
But a quadrotor moving in the two-dimensional vertical plane is fundamentally different,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.810
as is a quadrotor moving in three-dimensions,

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.719
but we'll get to that in the next lesson.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.780
This two-dimensional system has two properties that

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.314
the one-dimensional system did not, under-actuation and coupling.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.342
Let's start with under-actuation.

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:48.865
Notice, that now we have three degrees of freedom,

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.800
Y, Z, and phi.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.244
But we only have two variables that we can set directly, U1 and U2.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:59.169
If you try to use these two variables to

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.395
control all three degrees of freedom simultaneously,

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.881
you will find that it just cannot be done.

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.908
Such a system is under-actuated.

00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:13.790
Luckily, for us, it's still possible to control two of the degrees of freedom,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.885
as long as we sacrifice control of the third degree of freedom.

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.630
So, for our purposes in this lesson,

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:26.479
we will be able to define a trajectory with particular values of Y and Z for instance,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.350
and you'll be able to write a controller that can actually follow that trajectory.
