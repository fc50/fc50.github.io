00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.025
In this lesson, you will learn how to design and implement

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:09.964
a full cascaded control of an underactuated quad moving in two dimensions.

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:13.984
You've going to get there in three main steps.

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:16.277
First, we'll start by linearizing

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:21.245
the 2D dynamic equations that I've shown you a few times already.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:25.250
Linearization is an incredibly useful mathematical tool

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.115
that's used throughout robotics to tame the math when it becomes hard to work with.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:31.844
And in this case,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:34.859
linearization will also lead to decoupling of

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.445
the dynamics of the system in the y and z directions,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:44.185
which means we'll be able to think about each of these directions completely separately.

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:48.030
Next, we'll find that y control in the z direction can still use

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
a single PID controller like the one you have worked with in the last lesson.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.993
The y direction won't be quite as easy.

00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:58.765
To control the vehicle in the y direction,

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:03.625
we will need to introduce what's called the cascaded control structure.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.655
Once you're comfortable with a cascaded control architecture,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:11.269
we will reintroduce the nonlinear equations of motion

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.515
and you will implement a full non-linear cascaded controller,

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:19.474
which controls a drone that can move in the y or z plane.

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:24.775
This is an important stepping stone to watch the full 3D control of a quadrotor.

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:27.530
Remember, the quadrotor is symmetric and the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.000
forward-back motion will be very similar to the left-right motion.
