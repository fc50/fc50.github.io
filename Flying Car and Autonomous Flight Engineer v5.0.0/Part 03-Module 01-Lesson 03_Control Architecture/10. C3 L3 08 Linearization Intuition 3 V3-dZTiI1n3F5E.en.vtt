00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.758
We just incorporated the fact that phi is small,

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:06.179
and we got rid of our sines and cosines,

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.059
and now our equations look like this.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.910
And what I really like about these equations,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.983
is that the set acceleration depends only on U1,

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:19.615
and phi acceleration depends only on U2.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:23.000
The one thing that's bothering me still,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.750
is this Y term because it contains the product of two variables, U1 and phi.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.159
At this point, it helps to remember that near hover U1 will just be

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:40.099
equal to MG plus some small deviation delta U1,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.649
which can be positive or negative.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.534
And likewise, when we linearize around hover,

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.119
phi will be close to its value at hover.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.394
So phi will be zero plus some small deviation delta phi.

00:00:55.395 --> 00:01:02.689
Now, if we plug these versions of phi and U1 into the equations for Y double dot,

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.299
we find the following.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.200
After multiplying out these terms,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.625
we are left with the equation for Y double dot.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:14.049
The first term is G times delta phi.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.189
And remember, we are assuming delta phi is very small,

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.340
so this product will be a small number.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.530
But the second term has this delta U times delta phi,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.445
which is a very small number times another very small number.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:35.789
And the key insight behind most linearization is this,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.975
the product of a very small number times a very small number,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:45.780
is a tiny number whose value is so small that it can be safely ignored.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.204
And that means, we can just cancel out this last term,

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:53.204
and we are left with the following equation.

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:58.079
And remember, near Hover delta phi and phi are the same thing.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.459
So, this equation reduces to the following truly linear equation for Y double dot,

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.744
Y double dot equals G times phi.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:12.520
And that gives us the full linearized decoupled dynamics.
