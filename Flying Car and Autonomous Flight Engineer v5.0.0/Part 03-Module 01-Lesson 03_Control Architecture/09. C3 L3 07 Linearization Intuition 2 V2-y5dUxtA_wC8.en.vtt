00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.005
When hovering, role must be zero.

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.134
If it variant then y double dot would be non-zero.

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:09.969
y and z can be anything,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.415
and this makes sense intuitively.

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.509
A quadrotor can hover here or it can hover over there.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.785
The values of its y and z coordinates don't matter.

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:26.125
It's thrust, u1 must be empty to support the weight.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:31.149
And u2 must two zero to ensure zero rotational acceleration.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.030
So we are linearizing around the state in the system where these statements are true.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.880
And I want to point out that while

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.540
these exact values must hold for the quadrotor to hover.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.479
We want to linearize around hover.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.974
When we linearize around an equilibrium point,

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:56.230
we aren't just solving the control problem for that one equilibrium configuration.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.759
In this case hover,

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:03.549
but we find an approximation for other configurations that are nearby in the state space.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.030
So, the next thing I want to do in this derivation is

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.810
figure out the consequences of phi being close to zero.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.010
As you can see phi shows up in the sine in the y term and the cosine in the z term.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.865
And both of these contribute to the non-linearity of the system.

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:24.458
So it will be good to simplify this part.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:30.790
So let's look at what happens to the one term sine of phi when phi is close to zero.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.640
And to do this let's zoom in.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.864
When we measure phi in radians and then zoom in very close to phi is equal to zero.

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:46.899
The graph of y equals to sine of phi looks almost identical to y is equal to phi.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.990
Linearization finds the line that is the tangent to the operating point.

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:59.769
And here the line tangent to sine of phi at phi equal to zero is y equals phi.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.709
So, if we are trying to approximate

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.369
sine of phi in the neighborhood of phi is equal to zero.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.344
It seems like we should just replace sine of phi with phi.

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:13.884
Likewise, if we zoom in on the cosine function.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.090
We can see that cosine of phi and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.944
its tangent line are about equal to one when phi is small.

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:22.870
So we can replace cosine of phi with

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.659
one and that will change our z double dot equation.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.444
This is a big step.

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:31.379
We've gotten rid of our sines and cosines.
