00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.335
We're now going to dive into a cascaded controller.

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:08.540
It's effectively a nested dual controller where there's

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.990
an inner loop controller and an outer loop controller. Take this drone.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.140
At the very basics,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.100
you might want to control roll and pitch.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.150
Perhaps, to have an enclosement or perhaps to affect your position.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.925
That itself is a controller because it has to

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.355
make sure that we don't overshoot in our desired angle.

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.525
But where does it come from?

00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:35.015
It comes from a higher level controller that

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.960
uses roll as a way to get to a certain location.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.785
So you want to build a drone that goes from A to B in a physical realistic way,

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.020
you need to cascade two controllers,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.885
one that controls the physical location through volume pitch,

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:52.020
and one really for actually getting to the right volume pitch.
