00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
The fundamental idea of linearization is to approximate

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.820
a non-linear equation locally by a linear equation.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.800
To explain this idea,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.929
let's leave the world of quadrotors and just talk about the mass for a second.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
Take this quadratic function for example,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.929
f of x = x squared.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.664
And let's say we want to linearize this function around x = 1.

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:31.714
We call x = 1 the operating point.

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:37.712
We want to find a straight line that best approximates the graph at this point,

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:39.680
which means it has to pass through

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.119
this point and it has to have the same slope at this point.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.239
We can find the slope of the parabola at

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.539
this point using calculus and pretty quickly find

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.469
that this is the tangent line to the graph of the parabola at the operating point.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.219
Now, if you zoom in close to the operating point,

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.569
you can see that in this region,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.979
the blue and the black line are really close to each other.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.855
So the blue line is a really good linear approximation of y = x squared in this region.

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:20.484
Now, what's the equation of this blue line?

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:24.385
What linear equation gives a good approximation to

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.719
f of x equals x squared when x is close to 1?

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.700
Well, the equation for this line winds up being 2 x - 1.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.359
But there's a more informative way we can write that.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.980
Now, I wrote this equation in a very particular way.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.870
Let me explain. First, look at this x - 1.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.590
Another way to think of this term is as delta x.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.250
It tells you how far x is from the operating point,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.215
which in this case was 1.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.260
Then there's this one over here.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.535
That's just the value of the original function at the operating point of x = 1.

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:11.634
The original function was x squared and 1 squared is just 1.

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:13.769
Then there's this 2.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.730
This 2 winds up being the slope of the original function at the operating point.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.784
And you can get that by taking the derivative of the original function.

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:28.384
And so we are left with this very general result.

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:34.429
This says that the equation of the best linear approximation of a function around

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.909
an operating point is just the value of

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.515
that original function plus this other term which is just the slope,

00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:48.979
f prime, times the deviation from the operating point delta x.
