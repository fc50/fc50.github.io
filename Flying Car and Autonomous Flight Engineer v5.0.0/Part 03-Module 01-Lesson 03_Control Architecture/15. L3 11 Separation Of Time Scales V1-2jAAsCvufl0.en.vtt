Congratulations!

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.390
Hopefully at this point you've implemented your first Cascade controller.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.539
I mentioned earlier that we want the outer loop,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.660
in this case the right position loop of a controller to be

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.410
able to rely on the inner loop of the inner controller.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.759
Why? Because the outer loop assumes it can actually command phi.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.020
So, it basically assumes that the phi command is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.829
achieved at the time it computes the next target value.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.814
What that means is that whenever the outer loop gets executed the inner loop

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:40.079
should have reached whatever rule had been commanded by the outer loop previously.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.924
And in order for that to happen the inner loop

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:46.699
needs to be running on a faster time scale than the outer loop.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.609
In the next exercise,

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.000
you'll explore that idea a little more deeply.
