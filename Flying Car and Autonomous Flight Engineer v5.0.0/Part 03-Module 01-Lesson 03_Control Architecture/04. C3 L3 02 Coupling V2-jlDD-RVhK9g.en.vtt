00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
In the previous video,

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:05.016
I mentioned that if you want to control y and z,

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:07.592
you have to sacrifice control of phi.

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.439
And one way of understanding why this

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:14.184
is the case is to look at how these equations are coupled.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.475
So, looking at the y equation,

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:19.415
we see there's a sine phi term.

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:24.399
So, this means that y behavior is somehow tied to the roll angle phi.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.104
In the z equation,

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.405
you can see there's also a phi term,

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:34.460
a cosine phi, which means that z behavior is also tied to the roll angle.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.145
So, we can say that y and z motion are coupled through the roll angle phi.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.940
Let's think through what would happen if we tried to

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.128
simultaneously control y, z, and phi.

00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:49.559
First, let's control some phi behavior.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.355
Well, looking at the last equation of motion,

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.339
you can see that we can do this but

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.520
it will require spending one of our control variables,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.500
in this case, u2.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.990
Next, we could specify y behavior.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.170
But since we've already fixed phi,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.140
we have to spend our other control variable to fix y,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.355
in this case u1.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:15.064
Now, if you try to specify z, we find that we can't.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.799
We've already used up most of our control variables and we have

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.284
no more control knobs left to turn to influence the system.

00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:26.254
So, you can see that the messiness of the system,

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:27.875
is in some ways,

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.950
due to the coupling inherent in the system.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.719
If you want a picture to demonstrate this coupling,

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.560
you can think of a vehicle pitched at some angle phi.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.820
Any thrust that it commands will be shared in the y and z directions.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.329
This coupling has important consequences for the controller architecture,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.000
which you'll understand by the end of this lesson.
