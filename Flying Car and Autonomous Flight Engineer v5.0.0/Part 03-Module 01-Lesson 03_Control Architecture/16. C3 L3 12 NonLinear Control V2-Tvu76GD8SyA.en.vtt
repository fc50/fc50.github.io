00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
The cascaded controller you have been working with

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.644
uses the Linearized Dynamics we discussed earlier.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.990
And now it's time to convert that controller to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.445
a non-linear controller based on the non-linear dynamics we started with.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.519
And this isn't too much of a change,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.500
we still aim to have three double integrator equations that we control but to get

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.585
those this time we need some non-linear transformations,

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:32.443
as a result there are two big changes to the overall data flow.

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:36.510
Now we have to recap all the z and y motions by

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:41.655
passing the commanded thrust to the by position controller as well as to the drone.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:45.660
And notice that we chose the command thrust based

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.309
only on the desires that motion and the current measured angle phi.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.975
We don't consider the effect that thrust will have on the y motion.

00:00:54.975 --> 00:01:00.795
Even so that command thrust will wind up impacting both the z and y motion.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:02.969
In the next activity,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.784
you will turn the linear controller you've been working with into a non-linear one.

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:11.250
The actual mass that you'll implement is shown below.
