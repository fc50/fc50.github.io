00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Now that we have our linearized equations that should work well around the hover state,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.289
we need to actually use these equations to control the state of the vehicle.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.644
And looking at these equations,

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:17.750
it's easiest to think about how you would control the z position of the drone.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.070
In fact, we have seen this very equation in the last lesson.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.190
There, we have defined U1 bar to

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.740
remind us just how directly we can control a z acceleration.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.584
By properly setting U1,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:35.620
you can directly set the vertical acceleration of the drone.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.074
And as time passes,

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:44.065
this influences the vertical velocity which over time influences the vertical position.

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:45.784
And in the last lesson,

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:50.794
you learned how to use a PID controller to control exactly this system.

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:53.899
And in fact, we will use a very similar controller in

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.469
this lesson to control the altitude of our 2D drone.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.689
But how do we control the y position?

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:04.769
This is still a second order system and we are

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.079
still going to control y through its second derivative.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.030
So we will still have something like this.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.430
And when we look at equation 1,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.610
we can see that we need to change phi to set y double dot.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.894
But we don't have direct control over phi.

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:27.140
We only have control over its second derivative.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.864
So this thing we have control over is U2.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:33.214
We want to control y.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:38.540
So what we need to do is to use U2 to set phi double dot.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.065
After two integrations, this will give us a phi which relates directly to y double dot.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:47.819
Then, after two more integrations,

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.299
this gives us y position.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.745
In short, we can control y but we have to do it through phi.

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:58.550
And when we think about the system this way,

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.519
we can see that U2 bar is equal to the fourth derivative of the y position.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:08.377
So we can enforce a step change in y for a triple dot,

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:13.120
but we cannot enforce a step change in any lower derivative.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.240
Take a second to think about this.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.000
What are the implications for control?
