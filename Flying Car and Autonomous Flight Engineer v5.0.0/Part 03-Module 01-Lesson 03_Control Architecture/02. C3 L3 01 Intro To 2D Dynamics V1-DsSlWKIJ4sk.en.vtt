00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
Welcome back. In the last lesson,

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.189
you learned about PID control,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.589
and how it can be used to control a vehicle

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.650
that moves purely in the vertical set direction.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.769
The equation underlying these dynamics look like this.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.504
And here, z double dot is the acceleration in the z direction,

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:21.669
and u1 is a total upward thrust control input.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.504
And m and g represent mass and gravitational acceleration.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.520
And since m and g are constants,

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.875
they actually aren't that interesting mathematically.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.859
So, another way of writing this equation is like this.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.509
Where u1 bar equals g minus u1 over n.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.699
And this rewriting of that equation,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.490
helps us to remember that we have direct control over z double dot.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.960
This lesson is all about solving

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.914
control problems where the dynamics get a bit more complicated.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:52.814
Recall from lesson one,

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.774
the dynamics of a 2D quadrotor moving in the yz plane.

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:59.129
The equations of motion looked like this.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.330
And we're going to be dealing with these equations throughout this lesson.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.664
And for now, I want you to focus your attention on this u1 and u2.

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:11.385
These variables represent the total applied thrust from the rotors,

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.609
and the total applied torque from the rotors respectively.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.170
And they're both quantities which we can control directly.
