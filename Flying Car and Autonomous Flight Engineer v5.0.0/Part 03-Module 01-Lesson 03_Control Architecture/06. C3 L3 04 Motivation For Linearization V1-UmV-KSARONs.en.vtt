00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
These equations are really useful equations.

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:08.774
They tell us what will happen for any angle and any thrust and any torque.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.600
So, these equations are good because one,

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.890
they for the most part capture the true physics of the system.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.795
And because of that, they can make

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.490
pretty accurate predictions about how the systems will change in time.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.750
And two, these equations work at any angle for any controls.

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.030
They don't break down when numbers get too big or too small.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.760
And in general, this is why you use non-linear equations when you choose to use them.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:43.448
But these are not linear differential equations,

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.089
the equations would be linear if

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.470
the right hand side of each of the equations would be in a form like this,

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.750
where the cs are constants.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.200
So, no sine, cosine or multiplication of input and state like u times phi.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.510
If you try to plot them as a function of u1 of phi or any of the variables,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.920
you would get straight lines.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.200
And control theorists love when equations are linear.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.290
We have a large tool set of linear control techniques

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.635
for which we can prove stability in a straightforward way.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:20.460
We love linear equations so much that sometimes we'll bend over

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:25.123
backwards to find linear approximations for non-linear equations like this.

00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:27.000
And in the next few segments,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.310
I want to show you some intuition for how we linearize these sorts of equations.
