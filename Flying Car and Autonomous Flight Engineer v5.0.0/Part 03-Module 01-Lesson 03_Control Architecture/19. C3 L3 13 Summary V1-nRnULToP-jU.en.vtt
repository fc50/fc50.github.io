00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Congratulations!

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:05.300
You've implemented some pretty serious control logic in

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.365
this lesson and learned quite a bit about control theory in the process.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:13.720
First, you saw how the 2D plane of quadrotor is

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.514
an underactuated system because while it has three degrees of freedom, with its y, z,

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:24.515
and phi coordinates, they only directly control two quantities,

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:27.205
the thrust and the rotational movement,

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:29.619
which we called U1 and U2.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.615
Then you saw how we could directly control two of those three degrees of freedom,

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:41.345
namely y and z, if we sacrifice control of the third degree of freedom.

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:45.231
Then we started thinking about how we would control y and z,

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:51.327
and you saw that when we linearize the dynamics of the system around the hover state,

00:00:51.327 --> 00:00:55.070
the equations that governed y and z became decoupled,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.665
which meant we could control each independently.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:03.230
U1 could be used to control the altitude and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.945
U2 could be used to control the lateral motion in the y direction.

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:10.665
Then we noticed something interesting,

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:15.770
and that was how U2 controlled the motion in the y direction.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.095
Instead of controlling y directly,

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:23.675
it did so by first controlling the intermediate variable of roll, or phi.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:29.675
This realization led us to use a cascaded control structure where you first

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:35.640
implemented and tuned the inner faster control loop which controlled the roll angle,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.625
and once that was working,

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:42.260
you implemented a slower outer control loop which took information about

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.555
the y trajectory and used it to set the target roll angle for the inner controller.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:50.215
In the next lesson,

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:54.100
you'll be taking the complexity and realism up a level by

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.000
designing a controller for quadrotor of that operates in a three-dimensional world.
