00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
The first thing we did in the previous example,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.740
was to choose the operating point that we wanted to linearize around.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
The first step in linearizing any non linear system is

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
to choose some state of the system to linearize around.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.195
Now, let's think about quadrotors again.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.993
What state of the system does it make sense to linearize around?

00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:24.855
What should we choose as an operating point?

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:30.902
Since our approximations are only valid in a small region around the operating point,

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:34.965
it's helpful to linearize around an equilibrium state.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:41.763
An equilibrium exists when we can find certain fixed and non changing control inputs,

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:45.460
where the velocities and accelerations in the y,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.215
z and phi dimensions are all zero.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.415
Intuitively, this is a state that the vehicle can

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:55.128
actually stay at for an extended period of time.

00:00:55.128 --> 00:01:02.149
For a quadrotor, the only state that is in equilibrium is usually called hover.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.894
I'm going to ask some questions about hover.

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:08.464
You can answer any of these by thinking mathematically,

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.829
or intuitively about what it means to hover.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.000
But try to use both approaches before you submit any of the answers.
