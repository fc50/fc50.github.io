00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
Welcome back. In this lesson,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.689
we're going to analyze a longitudinal motion of fixed-wing vehicles.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.720
We're going to start by using the equations we developed in the last lesson,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.060
to write down the non-linear equations of motion

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.910
for the longitudinal motion of a fixed-wing vehicle.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.100
These non-linear equations will be really

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.540
useful when we're trying to simulate fixed-wing flight,

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.839
but not as useful for actually analyzing an aircraft's actual motion.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.149
To do useful mathematical analysis of fixed-wing flight,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.399
we'll need to first linearize the equations of motion around a trim state.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.129
Once we have a linear model,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.120
we'll use some of the tools of linear algebra to answer

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:41.239
some important questions about the motion and stability of fixed-wing vehicles.
