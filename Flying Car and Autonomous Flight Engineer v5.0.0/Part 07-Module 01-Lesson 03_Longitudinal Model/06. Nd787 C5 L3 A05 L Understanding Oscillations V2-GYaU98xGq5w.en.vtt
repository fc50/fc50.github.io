00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.925
In the previous exercise,

00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:04.770
you simulated the longitudinal motion of a vehicle,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.764
with an initial state that's very close to a trim state.

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.734
When you plotted the pitch rate of that vehicle versus time,

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.019
you saw a graph that looked like this.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.269
This graph seems pretty strange,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.234
and you might have some questions about it.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.824
After all, if we are near an equilibrium state,

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.405
where the pitching moment is zero,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.825
why are we seeing this strange oscillation?

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:27.304
If we were to build the aircraft that we modeled and actually fly it,

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:28.864
would we see this behavior?

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:31.439
Or, maybe what we're seeing is an artifact of

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.390
the discretization that we had to do to simulate this motion on a computer.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.840
Or, if this oscillation is real,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.560
then we'd like to know more about it.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.280
For example, will these oscillations go away?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.700
If so, how long will it take?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.425
Can we design our vehicle in a way that minimizes these oscillations?

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:50.914
We'd like to answer all of these questions.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:53.564
Unfortunately, with the equations written as they are,

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:58.489
we just don't have the mathematical tools necessary to analyze this motion rigorously.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.400
It's hard to get the non-linear equations underlying

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.599
the dynamics of this vehicle to explain what is going on.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.125
So, as you've seen a few times in this nanodegree program,

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:11.900
we're going to want to turn our non-linear model into a linear model,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.280
so we can actually analyze these dynamics and answer these questions.
