00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
We begin this lesson by looking at

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:06.264
the nonlinear equations of motion for the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle,

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:10.750
and we use these equations to simulate the state of a vehicle forward in time.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.679
When the aircraft is in initial state that's close

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.289
to but not exactly equal to a trim state,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.109
you saw that its motion does some surprising things.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.169
We wanted to know where this weird behavior came from,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.700
but realized we couldn't really do much to analyze the nonlinear equations of motion.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.059
So, we linearized the dynamics around the trim state and

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.570
found that the eigenvalues told us a lot about the motion of the vehicle.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.420
In particular, we found

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.530
four interesting eigenvalues which came as two complex conjugate pairs.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.219
Both of these pairs had negative real parts which meant that they were stable,

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.609
but their non-zero imaginary parts meant that they were also oscillatory.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.335
These motion modes are well-known phenomena.

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.509
We call the faster mode the short-period response,

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.549
and the slower mode is called phugoid.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.789
Trying to fight these natural modes of motion can be tricky,

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.119
and you'll learn more about fixed-wing control and autopilots after the next lesson.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.509
In the next lesson, we'll analyze a lateral directional dynamics of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.440
a fixed-wing vehicle using a similar approach to what we used here.
