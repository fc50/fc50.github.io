00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.304
The nonlinear equations that we came up with earlier looked like this.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.574
If we want to write them more succinctly,

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:10.265
we can gather all of these variables into a vector called x-dot,

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:15.970
and write x-dot equals some function of the state vector x and the control input u.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.155
We want the linearize model around some trim state,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.445
I'm going to call this state x-star.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.574
The controls necessary to maintain this state, I'll call u-star.

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:30.754
Then, we can define deviations from equilibrium as x-bar and u-bar.

00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:35.409
So, x-bar is just the actual state x minus the trim state x-star.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.089
U-bar is the actual controls minus the controls of trim.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.290
This means we can define the equations of motion around trim by finding x-bar-dot,

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.960
which is just x-dot minus x-star-dot.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.179
When you go through the math of linearizing this system,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.375
which will present in text below this video,

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.829
you'll find that x-bar-dot is approximated by

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.394
Jacobian times the deviation of the state from equilibrium,

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:02.730
plus another Jacobian times the deviation of the controls.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.359
You might remember doing exactly this in building

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.694
the process model for the extended Kalman filter in the estimation module.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.809
These Jacobians are just matrices,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.799
which means we can write the dynamics model as

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.530
a linear system around the trim state and trim controls,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.905
where x-bar-dot equals A times x-bar plus B times u-bar.

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.754
We call this A matrix the stability matrix,

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:27.894
and we call B the control effect matrix.

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:31.299
Now, remember what x-bar and u-bar represent?

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.844
They are the deviation of state from trim and the deviation of the controls from trim.

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:40.159
When you saw the strange plots earlier in the lesson,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.179
we weren't changing the controls from their trim values at all.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.505
So, the deviation would have been zero.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:50.244
This whole B times u term wouldn't have contributed to the dynamics at all.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:53.359
So, the dynamics are even simpler.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.719
We just have the stability matrix times the deviation of the state from trim.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.799
We found this matrix by taking the partial derivatives of

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.814
the six state transition functions with respect to the six state variables.

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:07.239
So, it's a six by six square matrix.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.009
This square matrix is really what we need to analyze in order

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.639
to understand the strange plots we saw earlier.
