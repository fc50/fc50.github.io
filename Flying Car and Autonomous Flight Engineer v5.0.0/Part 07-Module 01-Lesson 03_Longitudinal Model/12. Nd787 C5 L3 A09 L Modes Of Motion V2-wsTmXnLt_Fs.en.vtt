00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
The eigenvectors of the stability matrix describe the "modes" of the system.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:07.540
So, if the initial state of the system has some eigenvector Vi,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.919
then the motion will be along the line spanned by Vi,

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.855
and the motion as a function of time looks like this.

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:19.024
The Lambda i in this equation is just the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector Vi.

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:21.445
When we analyze this stability matrix,

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:24.120
we're often analyzing these eigenvalues since

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.130
this complex exponential e to

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.769
the Lambda it actually tells us a lot about the motion of the vehicle.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.710
As you just saw, this Lambda will,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.664
in general, be a complex number,

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:37.289
a plus b times i.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.515
This a is referred to as the real part of the eigenvalue and the b is the imaginary part.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:46.009
A complex exponential describes motion that is some combination of

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.814
oscillation along with exponential growth or decay.

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:52.780
When the real part of the eigenvalue is negative,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.965
the motion for the corresponding mode will be stable.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:59.865
Which means that when the system is perturbed from the trim state,

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.530
it will eventually return to the trim state.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.430
When the real part of the eigenvalue is positive,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.315
the motion for the corresponding mode is unstable.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:13.375
Which means that small deviations from trim will tend to grow with time.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:17.290
So, when the real parts of all of the eigenvalues are negative,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.484
the system will be stable overall.

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:21.144
For a flying vehicle,

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.179
this means that the aircraft will always

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.490
want to return to trim after it's been disturbed.

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:27.920
For example, by a gust of wind.
