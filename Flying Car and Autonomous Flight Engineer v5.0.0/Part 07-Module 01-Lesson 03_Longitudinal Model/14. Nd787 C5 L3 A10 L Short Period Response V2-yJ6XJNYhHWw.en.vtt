00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
At this point, we can actually explain

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.570
the strange motion that we saw earlier in this lesson.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.925
The graph we saw for pitch rate versus time looks something like this.

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:15.685
And remember, we generated this graph by putting the vehicle into a near trim state,

00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:20.010
and then simulating the motion using unknown linear dynamics model.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.190
We can explain this motion as the combination of

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.355
two decaying exponentials with oscillations.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.030
One has a long period,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.695
it decays somewhat slowly,

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:34.030
and the other has a much shorter period and decays much more quickly.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.859
In fact, this behavior is a real thing and well-known in fixed-wing aircraft design.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.340
When you take the eigenvalues of the stability matrix for a realistic aircraft,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.365
you will get six eigenvalues.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:48.289
Two of them will be equal to zero,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.859
these just correspond to horizontal and vertical displacement of the aircraft.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.545
The remaining four eigenvalues comes two conjugate pairs of complex numbers.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:01.250
One pair of eigenvalues corresponds to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.305
this short period motion and is typically called a short period response.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:07.730
It's a transient oscillation and very quickly

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.245
dies out as the aircraft returns to the trim state.

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:16.719
The other pair of eigenvalues corresponds to this slower and longer term oscillation,

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.825
this motion is called phugoid.

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:20.750
On aircraft that carry passengers,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.965
this phugoid can feel like a gentle rolling motion.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:28.094
Ideally, the aircraft will be designed to minimize the amplitude of phugoid,

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:31.920
but it can occur when moving from trim state to trim state.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.079
When working with real aircraft,

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.950
it's important to recognize phugoid and understand what's happening.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
For example, adding control inputs to counteract the phugoid motion directly can

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:48.319
sometimes make things worse in a process known as pilot induced oscillation.
