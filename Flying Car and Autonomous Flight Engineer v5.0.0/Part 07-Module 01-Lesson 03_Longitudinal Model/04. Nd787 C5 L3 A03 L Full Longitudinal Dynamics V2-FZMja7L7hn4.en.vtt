00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
We have these equations of motion for force-free motion.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.589
Now, we can incorporate the forces and the pitching moment from the previous lesson.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.594
Since forces and moments influence accelerations and rotational accelerations,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.019
these first three equations will not be changed.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.644
Of these last three equations,

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.239
q-dot is the easiest.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.699
It will just be equal to the pitching moment divided by

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.434
the moment of inertia about the y-axis.

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:26.829
We're going to handle u-dot and w-dot similarly.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.654
Remember that these give the x and z acceleration of the vehicle in the body frame.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:34.655
What we're going to do is write the accelerations like this.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.359
We've just added the contributions from Fx and Fz,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.939
which represent the total force on the vehicle in its body frame.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.119
To figure out what these forces are,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.109
we can imagine a vehicle with some pitch angle,

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.484
Theta, and angle of attack, Alpha.

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.539
Thrust is aligned to the body frame,

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.679
weight points down in the inertial frame,

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.859
which means it's rotated from the body frame by Theta,

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.215
and the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag are aligned to the stability frame.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.375
So, they're rotated by Alpha.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.920
If we look at the x component of these forces,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.555
we find that Fx looks like this.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.200
If we look at the z component of these forces,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.960
we find that Fz looks like this.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.979
The lift and drag forces, L and D,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.620
and the pitching moment, M,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.805
are all exactly as we define them in the last lesson.

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:26.355
Remember, we have two longitudinal control terms for the elevator deflection and thrust.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:28.820
You don't see them in these equations because their effect

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.614
is buried in the specific equations for L,

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:36.449
D, and M. Remember that lift goes away when we exceed the stall angle of attack.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.290
These equations all assume we have laminar flow over the wing.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.920
In the next exercise,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.180
we'll provide you with a longitudinal model

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.835
for a vehicle that we've implemented in Python.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.549
You'll play around with this model by forward simulating

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.149
the state of the vehicle when it starts near trim state.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.965
The behavior you see might surprise you.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:57.469
Take some time to make sure you're comfortable with

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.679
these equations before moving on to the next exercise.
