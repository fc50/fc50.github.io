00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
The first step in building our nonlinear longitudinal model,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.754
is to identify what quantities we need to track.

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:10.039
For now, we're going to take this to be our state vector.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.410
Here, we have the x and z coordinates of the vehicle, in the inertial frame.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.335
Note that, for this lesson,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:21.269
z is positive upwards to make the math a bit more consistent with some other references.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.339
Theta is the pitch angle.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.899
U and W give the x,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.929
z velocity in the body frame,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.295
and Q is the pitch rate in the body frame.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.545
This is the same Q from the PQ and R body rates you've worked with earlier.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:38.425
Now, I'd like to quickly derive the equations of motion for the vehicle in two steps.

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:41.044
First, we'll consider motion with no forces,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.219
and then we'll consider motion with forces.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.289
Defining the equations of motion means,

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.384
figuring out how all the state variables change with time.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:53.164
The x and z derivatives give the velocity in the initial frame. They look like this.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:55.594
They are just the velocity in the body frame,

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:57.414
rotated by the pitch angle.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:59.960
Theta dot is just the pitch rate Q.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.620
The last three derivatives look like this.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.030
Q dot is zero,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.810
because there are no moments on the vehicle for now.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.780
Since there are no forces,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.224
you might expect U and W dot to be zero.

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.939
But if the vehicle is moving in the inertial frame with some velocity as it rotates,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.120
then the body frame velocities will not be the same from time-step to time-step.
