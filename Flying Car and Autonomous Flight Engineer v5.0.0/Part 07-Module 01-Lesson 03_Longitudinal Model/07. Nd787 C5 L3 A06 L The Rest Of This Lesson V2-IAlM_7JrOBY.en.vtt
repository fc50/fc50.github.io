00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.629
you'll be able to use a linear model of

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.234
the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle to actually answer the questions we just asked.

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.619
The analytical techniques you're going to use are pretty

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.064
straightforward but the math underlying them is not so simple.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:15.605
For the next part of this lesson,

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.490
I want to give you some intuitive sense for

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.695
how that math works without going too deep into the details.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.609
Let me sketch out the plan for the rest of this lesson.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.769
First, I'm going to show you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.149
a linearized version of the equations of motion you saw earlier.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.699
This linearized version will represent the dynamics of the system near

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
a trim state as x dot equals AX plus BU.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.159
This might look similar to

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.799
the state-transition function you saw when learning about common filters.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.809
Next, we're going to focus on this square A matrix,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.730
which is called the stability matrix,

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.009
and I'm going to explain how we can decompose

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.039
this matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.909
This decomposition will allow us to identify modes in the motion.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.069
These modes will have a term that looks something like E raised to

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.719
the A plus BI times T. This A plus BI is called a complex number.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.359
After that, you'll see how the exponential of a complex number actually leads to motion,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.655
which is a combination of oscillation with exponential growth or decay.

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:18.349
Finally, we'll put this altogether and

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.559
actually answer some of the questions we just asked.
