00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.991
With the exercises you've completed in the previous lessons,

00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:06.580
you're ready to tackle the final 3D motion planning project.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.179
If you're ready to dive in and complete the project,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.469
just go ahead and skip to

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.855
the next lesson where you will find instructions for getting started.

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:15.660
In this lesson, I'll present

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.949
some more advanced methods to take your project implementation above and beyond.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.759
But feel free to skip ahead or just come back to it later when you have some time.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.350
Okay, you're still here I see.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.965
Well then, let's get right into it.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.734
In most of the lessons so far,

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.854
we have assumed an idealized version of reality in physics.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.759
We have assumed the vehicle knows exactly where it is in the world.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.460
We have assumed the vehicle knows exactly where

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.844
every obstacle is in the world ahead of time,

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:44.019
and we've assumed that the vehicle was able

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.685
to follow a trajectory through the world perfectly.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.030
We've also assumed that as long as a path exists through

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.750
free space that we can command the vehicle to follow that path.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.340
In the real world,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.230
all of these assumptions break down.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.284
The information available in a map ahead of time is usually imperfect.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:03.129
And we've talked a little bit about what to do when obstacles

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.415
appear or are missing from the map at the time of flight.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.845
Sensor measurements like GPS have inherent errors.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:11.679
We talked about what to do when

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.080
environmental conditions can make following a trajectory challenging.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.929
A final issue is that all vehicles have constraints on

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.105
how they can move and you need to include those constraints in your planning solution.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.560
So, in this lesson, we'll touch on a couple

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.600
more of these elements of real world planning so that

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.799
you have the tools you need to take

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.000
your project implementation to the next level and deploy it on real hardware.
