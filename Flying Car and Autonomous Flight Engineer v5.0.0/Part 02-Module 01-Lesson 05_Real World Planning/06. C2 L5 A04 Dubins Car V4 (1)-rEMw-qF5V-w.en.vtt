00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
The dynamics models that we've talked about so far

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.495
have constraints that involve just the current state.

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:07.860
But remember, we have an autopilot that

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.275
allows us to control the motion of the vehicle so it

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:15.510
also makes sense to incorporate the control into the differential constraints as well.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.030
Very common dynamics model is what's known as

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.930
the Dubin's car has a state X, Y, and theta.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.315
And it has the following dynamics model which is that

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.865
X_dot is equal to the cosine of the current orientation,

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:30.790
Y_dot is the sine of the current orientation.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.700
And we also assume that we have the ability to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.280
steer the vehicle so we have a steering angle.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.190
U_phi, and we're going to use U in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.415
general to denote controls that we're giving to the vehicle.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:47.138
So we say U_phi to specify that as the steering angle phi of the wheels.

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:50.990
The change in orientation of the vehicle is the tangent of the steering angle.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.513
And presumably, we also have a constraint on the control.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.550
Let's say the steering angle is limited to be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.770
in the range minus pi over two to pi over two.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340
So, minus 90 to 90 degrees.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.660
Implicit in this is an assumption that the vehicle is moving at

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.130
a fixed velocity of one meter per second in a forward direction.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.610
This dynamics model is what's called the Dubin's car and there are different variants of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.220
the model that allow the forward velocity to vary or allow backwards motion as well.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.605
The Dubin's car is particularly relevant in the flying car domain,

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.870
because it's a pretty good model for fixed wing aircraft.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.480
There's an easy way to convert the steering angle in the model into

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.510
a flight path angle and bank angle commands that you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.698
would normally give to a fixed wing autopilot.

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.735
For our purposes in the upcoming project,

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:40.000
the Dubin's car model is not a particularly great representation of

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.560
true quadrotor dynamics to exactly follow a curve trajectory.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.059
The autopilot for quadrotor,

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:47.490
unlike a fixed wing aircraft,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.297
would have to constantly adjust the thrust vector through the curve.

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:52.570
Unlike a fixed wing vehicle,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.750
there isn't a single setting of the controls that will make

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.610
the quadrotor follow a curved path described by a specific steering angle.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.570
That being said, unless the quadrotor stops at each waypoint,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.386
the inertia of the vehicle is going to cause it to follow

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:12.220
some curved path as it changes direction and moves through a waypoint.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.423
If the plan looks like this,

00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:17.260
the quadrotor is not actually going to follow this exact trajectory,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.530
unless it stops at that waypoint.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.360
As the vehicle adjusts the thrust of individual motors in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.730
order to change the thrust vector from heading in this direction,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.005
to heading in this direction,

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.400
what's actually going to happen is that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.135
the quadrotor is going to either follow a curved path,

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:37.000
it looks like that, or maybe it starts adjusting it's heading

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.585
direction earlier and it will follow a curve path that looks more like that.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.820
This is just a function of the inertia.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.230
While the Dubin's car model isn't really the ideal model for quadrotor motion,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.375
physics tells us that a vehicle with inertia

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.425
is going to follow a curve path of some form.

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:56.530
Let's just assume for now that our quadrotor autopilot gives us the ability to follow

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.770
a specific curve path and thus the Dubin's car model

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.250
can serve as a reasonable vehicle model that we can incorporate into our plan.
