00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
What you've seen over the course of the last few lessons is that really,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.484
there could be as many as three stages of planning.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:08.820
There is a proximate global planning that takes into account

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
the full length scale of where the vehicle needs to go in order to complete its mission.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.869
This stage will include some approximate model of the obstacles and

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.030
free space which could be a 2D or 3D or even two and a half D map.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.210
A good global planning strategy might feature a global plan in 2D,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.620
but along the way,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.325
you can have a receding horizon 3D planner or second planner.

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.559
With this second planner, you're attempting to follow

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.530
the rough outline of the global plan but at the same time,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.039
avoiding local obstacles and responding to the unexpected.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.964
Beyond that, you can implement the third potential field planner for

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:43.740
local obstacle void at high speed

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.250
including known obstacles and things that are not already in the map.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.619
By combining all three of these planning layers,

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.804
you'll have the ability to implement different kinds of planners all working together

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:58.500
with each one offering different trade-offs in terms of planning efficiency,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.149
response time, complexity, and how much information is available ahead of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.010
time which will give your vehicle maximum flexibility and maximum reliability.
