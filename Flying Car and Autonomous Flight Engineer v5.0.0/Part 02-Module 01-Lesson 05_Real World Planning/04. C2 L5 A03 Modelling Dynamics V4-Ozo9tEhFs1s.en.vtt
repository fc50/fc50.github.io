00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
In solving the planning problem,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.645
we've ignored the mass of the vehicle,

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:05.745
and force is acting on it like gravity.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.414
But when you include forces and mass in your planning problem,

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.349
even when there aren't a lot of obstacles

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.035
around with complicated passages to fly through,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.859
you still need to think about issues like planning to fly slowly enough,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.195
that you have sufficient room to stop when you get close to an obstacle or waypoint.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:25.289
Remember, that the attitude of the vehicle directs the thrust vector.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.689
And so, you have to think about how quickly you can rotate

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.545
the vehicle to accelerate or decelerate.

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.340
The constraints on a vehicle's motion that result from

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.240
the vehicle's mass and forces acting on it are known as dynamic constraints.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.980
And dynamic constraints generally,

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:41.515
show up as a form of differential constraint.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:45.895
While there may be other differential constraints related to how the vehicle moves,

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.765
like the steering mechanism on a car for example, in this lesson,

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.759
we're going to look at how to find plans for

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.839
vehicles that have differential constraints of all kinds.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.175
The first thing you need to work out is how to specify differential constraints.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:00.899
In some cases, it's easy.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.449
For example, imagine a vehicle flying in

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.480
a strong prevailing wind blowing in the positive x direction.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.230
If your constraint is that you must be able to tolerate any crosswind velocity,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.730
but you can never fly upwind,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.840
then this constraint can be written as a derivative on x is greater than zero.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.820
Now, for a flying car,

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.084
you might also have acceleration constraints,

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:24.164
which are constraints on how quickly you can accelerate or decelerate.

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:28.895
Acceleration constraints are a function of the second derivative of the state.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:33.354
A common form of differential constraint is what's called the vehicle model.

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:36.085
The vehicle model addresses questions like,

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:39.625
"What motion is the vehicle capable of given its current state?

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.680
How do you specify the possible trajectories

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.095
the vehicle can take from its current state?"

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:48.310
This is usually written as a differential equation or set of equations.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.340
For instance, suppose you have a vehicle that is

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.195
constrained to fly in a counterclockwise motion in a circle.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:02:00.369
We can write a model for this as x-dot is equal to minus y and y-dot is equal to x.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.710
In this case, the vehicle is constrained to fly in

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.144
a circle of unit radius centered at the origin.

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:09.004
This model says that the vehicle motion has to always be tangent to the circle.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:14.074
These sorts of equations are often how we specify how a flight vehicle is able to move.

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:18.259
A challenge with specifying the motion of the vehicle this way is that you can no

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.149
longer do simple line drawing to check

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.909
whether a path between two states is in free space.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.770
You have to integrate the model forward to know what the path is going to look like.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.784
Integration can be complicated,

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:32.990
especially for nonlinear dynamics models like this.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.550
If you're lucky, you can solve

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.745
the differential equations explicitly for the state at any time t,

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.980
but if not, you have to use a numerical integration scheme.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.935
The simplest integration scheme is to assume a linear approximation,

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:48.640
so that you can write this dynamics model as a set of difference equations,

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.929
such as xt plus one is equal to xt plus yt, delta-t.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.465
In this case, you have to pick some value of delta-t.

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.594
The larger the value you pick for delta-t,

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:01.164
the worse your linear approximation is going to be for nonlinear systems.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.164
So, for this model constraining the vehicle to fly in a circle,

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:08.829
the linear approximation would look like a series of straight line segments like this.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.520
Similarly, yt is equal to yt plus xt

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.855
times delta-t. Small values of delta-t are going to be a better approximation again,

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:18.699
but more computationally demanding.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.129
Large values of delta-t are easier to simulate,

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.734
but a worse approximation.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.655
To apply this approximation,

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:28.284
you would need to iterate on xt and yt from say,

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:30.460
zero to some point in the future.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.310
In the next exercise, you'll get a chance to implement

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.659
an integration scheme for a dynamics model using the linear approximation.
