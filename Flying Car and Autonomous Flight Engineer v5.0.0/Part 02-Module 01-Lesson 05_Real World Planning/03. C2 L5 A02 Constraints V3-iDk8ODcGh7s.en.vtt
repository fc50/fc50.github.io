00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Restrictions on the states that a vehicle can

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.235
physically be in are called kinematic constraints.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.900
In other words, these are constraints on motion that aren't a result of force or mass.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.730
Kinematic constraints are generally,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.610
a function of geometry and for flying cars,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.715
they arise primarily as a result of the distribution of obstacles in the environment.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:23.010
You can think of the kinematic constraints as defining the boundary

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.055
between the feasible and infeasible parts of your configuration space.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:31.680
Any feasible motion plan must satisfy the kinematic constraints.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.830
There are, however, other constraints on motion that can arise from

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.905
how a vehicle can move through space or what maneuvers it can perform.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.700
A quadrotor is a pretty amazing vehicle in that it can

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.705
more or less move in any direction, regardless of orientation.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:51.710
A car on the other hand does have a set of constraints on allowable motion.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.235
Still ignoring properties such as mass or the forces acting on the vehicles,

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:57.110
cars or at least most cars,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.525
cannot move in arbitrary directions.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.420
Cars are restricted to forward and backwards motion along

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.455
a line or an arc defined by the steering angle of the wheels.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.155
The constraints induced by your car steering mechanism

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:13.520
restrict the allowable changes to the state in configuration space.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.990
So, for example, just because your car is sitting next to an open parking spot,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.365
doesn't mean the parking problem is easy.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.655
If you don't consider restrictions on steering,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:25.985
then your motion planner might think that an action to the right like

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.665
this is perfectly feasible in terms of the kinematic constraints of the environment.

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:32.330
But in this case,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.790
it's the constraints on what your car can do in terms of

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.210
the allowable motion that makes this problem hard.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
It's really about restrictions on how the vehicle is allowed to change its state.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.080
These restrictions are called differential constraints,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.015
and as the name suggests,

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.915
these are constraints on the derivative of the state.

00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:53.960
So far, we have ignored differential constraints in our planning algorithms.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.345
We assumed that as long as a straight line exists

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:59.180
between two states through the free part of the configuration space,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.500
that it's feasible to include a motion between those states as part of the plan.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.895
It turns out that's actually a pretty reasonable assumption for a slow moving quadrotor.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:12.455
A vehicle of no differential constraints of any kind is called a holonomic vehicle.

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:14.375
The fact that all vehicles have mass,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.670
implies that there is always a constraint on how

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.445
fast a vehicle can accelerate or decelerate.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.755
But for vehicles like quadrotors,

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.870
we can often ignore these kinds of constraints.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.390
Vehicles that seem to have

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.010
no different constraints like quadrotors are called quasi-holonomic.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.640
And for these types of vehicles,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.210
solving the planning problem is often quite easy.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.220
But for vehicles that aren't Quasi-Holonomic,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.125
you need to think about allowable motions as part of the planning problem.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:44.110
When your quadrotor is moving at a significant velocity,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.590
you can no longer treat it as a Quasi-Holonomic vehicle.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
And next, we'll look at how to include its dynamics in your planning solution.
