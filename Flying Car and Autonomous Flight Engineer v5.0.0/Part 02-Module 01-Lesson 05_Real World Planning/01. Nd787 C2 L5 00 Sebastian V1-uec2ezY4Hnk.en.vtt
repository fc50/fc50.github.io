00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
You are now for a dose of realism,

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:08.414
full disclosure, we made a whole bunch of assumptions relational no correct in reality.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:11.250
One was the assumption of a perfect map.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.324
It turns out worlds change.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.414
We're going to look into imperfect maps from now on.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:21.089
Second, was assumption of a static environment,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.839
we assume that the only thing moving is yourself but in reality,

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.820
there's other things moving like other planes,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.859
or cars, or birds, what have you.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.034
Thirdly, we assumed that we had a robot that can completely control its state.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:41.984
Unfortunately, existing robots have what's called holonomic constraints,

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:43.725
they can't move at will.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:48.855
Here's an example, my car or your car can move at will forwards and backwards,

00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:50.804
but it can't move at will left or right.

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:51.920
In fact, to go left or right,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.050
we have engaged a maneuver that you bring the car

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.599
back and forth to get the desired motion.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.565
Same is true for my friend,

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:00.210
the drone, the drone,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.250
you might think of can go any direction it wants.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.375
But it turns out there is a holonomic constraint,

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.605
which is if you want to go left,

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.075
you can't just stay straight.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.120
You have to roll yourself,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.020
divert the air stream and then you're able to go left.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:17.090
There is a coupling between your left motion and your roll angle.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.939
Let's called a holonomic constraint and now we're going

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.730
to look into systems that have these holonomic constraints.
