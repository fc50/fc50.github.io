If you're new to Udacity, the structure and pace of the program might take some getting used to.  Whether you've studied with us before, or this is your first time in the Udacity classroom, we'd like to share some details with you here about this program, as well as some tips and suggestions for charting a path to a successful graduation.\n\n### Expected time commitment \nWe suggest you plan to spend 15 hours per week working on this program.  That said, everyone moves at a different pace through the content, which is largely determined by the skills you come into the program with, and how deep you dive into exploring these subjects beyond the lessons in the classroom.    Be deliberate! Put your study time on your calendar, and plan to do a little bit every day rather than pushing through large amounts of work at the last minute.\n\n### Classroom lessons vs. projects\nYou will be going through lessons in the Udacity classroom that give you the tools you need to complete the projects.  However, the projects are where the real learning takes place and where you will spend the majority of your time in this program.  Start the projects early and reach out to your fellow students in Slack or to the mentors in the classroom when you get stuck.  \n\n### Access to content on your mobile device\nWhile you can access the Udacity classroom on your mobile device, the lessons in this program will include numerous hands-on exercises like programming quizzes or following along with a demonstration in a virtual machine.  So feel free to catch up on the text and video content on your mobile device while on the train ride home, but you'll get much more out of the interactive content on your personal computer.  ",
