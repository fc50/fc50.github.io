00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
The code for a P Controller is pretty simple.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.870
And the output that this control strategy produces is already

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.175
much better than the quadratic error we saw with the open-loop controller,

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.110
which would have caused a crash.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.554
But it's clearly not perfect.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:19.425
I want to draw your attention to two problems.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.210
The first and most obvious problem is the oscillating behavior.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.130
The actual z, bounces up and down when it's supposed to be steady.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.698
The second problem is the offset.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:37.530
These oscillations aren't even centered on the target z.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
We are going to address both of these problems,

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.989
but let's start with the oscillations.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
At this point, you should spend some time playing

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.109
around with different values of this kp constant,

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.229
that relates error to command thrust.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.474
As you do, keep the following question in mind,

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.564
why are these oscillations occurring,

00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:03.320
and is it possible to get rid of them by tuning kp?
