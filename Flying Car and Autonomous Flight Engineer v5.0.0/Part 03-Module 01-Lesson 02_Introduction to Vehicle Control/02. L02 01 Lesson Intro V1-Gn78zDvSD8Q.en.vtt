00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Welcome back. So, what are we going to learn in this lesson Angela?

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.460
In this lesson, we are going to learn how to make a quadrotor do what we want it to do.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.370
And this may be as simple as hovering in the air.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.930
But in the last lesson,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.180
we already learned how to model the vehicle dynamics.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.875
Shouldn't hovering just be as simple as

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.200
the upward thrust needs to balance the downwards weight?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.819
Not exactly.

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.460
Our model was the simplification of the real world.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.030
And if we try to use only that model to control the drone,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.740
it would crash pretty quickly.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
Okay. So, if our model of vehicle dynamics isn't enough, what else do we need to do?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.020
What we really need to do,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.544
is to actively control the vehicle.

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:41.700
And not only think about what the drone should be doing based on our models,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.075
but also pay attention to what it actually is doing,

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.770
and make constant adjustments.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.390
Okay. Sounds good. Let's get started.
