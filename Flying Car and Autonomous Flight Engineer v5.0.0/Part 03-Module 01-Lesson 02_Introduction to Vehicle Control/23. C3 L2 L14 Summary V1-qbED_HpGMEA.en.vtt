00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
We began this lesson with

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.199
a naive open loop approach to control a monorotor in one dimension.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.359
But this approach had a big problem,

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.625
a single tiny error in how we modeled

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:17.714
the vehicle's mass led to a precision error that grew quickly overtime.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:22.875
We tried to correct that with a proportional P controller which increased the thrust

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:29.204
when the vehicle was too low and decreased the thrust when the vehicle was too high.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:33.369
This was an improvement but caused the vehicle to oscillate.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:37.739
So we added a derivative or D term to our controller

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.340
which tried to get the vehicle's actual velocity to match the target.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430
And this helped a lot.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.399
We are able to get rid of the oscillations and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.134
generally stay pretty close to the target trajectory.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.824
Then, you also saw how we could parameterize

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:59.520
this PD controller using parameters with real physical meeting.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.725
At this point, the monorotor was flying quite well.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:07.320
It just wasn't exactly hitting its target and

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.459
that was because of an underlying error in our model of the vehicle's mass,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.069
which was causing it to hover at an altitude that

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.104
was close to correct but not quite right.

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:21.520
We corrected this by introducing an integral I term,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.774
which accumulated this error and adjusted the control in the opposite direction.

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:30.990
Together, these PI and D terms made

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.059
a PID controller which could

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
precisely control the monorotor we built within this lesson.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
In the next lesson, you'll see how things change when we move into two-dimensional control.
