00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
So, how do we get rid of these oscillations?

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.463
The key is to add one more term to our controller equation.

00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:10.155
And remember, for the purposes of this lesson,

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.454
the controller sets a commanded acceleration.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.097
So, in addition to setting acceleration in proportion to the error,

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:20.009
we also look at the rate of change,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.140
or derivative of the error.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
And the subscript d here stands for derivative.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.588
And this equation is the equation for a PD or proportional derivative controller.

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:36.909
The intuition behind this d term is pretty straightforward.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.574
While the p term is responsible for adjusting the thrust

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.566
so that the vehicle's position matches the target position,

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.670
the d term is responsible for adjusting the thrust,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.530
so that the vehicle's velocity matches the target velocity.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
So, when the vehicle is rapidly ascending towards this target set,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.024
this term will oppose this rapid decrease in the size of the error,

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:07.890
and will cause the vehicle to slow down as it's approaching the target altitude.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.007
To implement this in code,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.558
recall how we've defined error.

00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:15.545
This means that the derivative of error is

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.920
just the difference between the target speed and the actual speed.
