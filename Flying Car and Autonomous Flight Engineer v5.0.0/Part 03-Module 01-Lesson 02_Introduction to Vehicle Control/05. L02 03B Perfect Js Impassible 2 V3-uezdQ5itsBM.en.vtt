00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
The vehicle would accelerate upwards because

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.634
the vehicle is lighter than the controller has assumed.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.279
But what will happen to our position over time?

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.934
Remember, we are assuming that the target Z is just some constant altitude.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.750
We first need to integrate Z double dot to get velocity or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.673
Z dot and then we integrate that with respect to time to get Z as a function of time.

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:33.363
With Z of zero being Z knot and Z dot of zero being zero,

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:37.905
the altitude was supposed to be Z knot forever.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:44.189
But now, it grows quadratically with time and all because of a small error in the mass.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:49.739
So the smallest error in our model can cause a huge mismatch

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.910
between what we think is happening based on our model and what actually happens.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.629
This quadratic error appears anytime we have

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.515
a double integrator system like the one we have here.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:08.075
We call a double integrator an unstable system.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.460
A stable system would have

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:15.794
some self-correcting ability and the mismatch would not grow infinitely.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:20.560
And it's important to note that these model errors are unavoidable.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.004
Our dynamics models are always an approximation of the real word.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:31.030
Understanding and addressing errors is so important to control that

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.298
we actually have different words for different types of error.

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:38.870
The type of error you just saw is called a model error,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.219
which just refers to an error in our model of the vehicle itself.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.905
In this case, our model misrepresented the true mass of the vehicle,

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:52.969
but there are many ways our model can fail to account for the true dynamics.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.844
Next, we have disturbances.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:02:01.454
These are errors caused by something external to the vehicle that we didn't anticipate.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:07.170
For example, a strong crossbreeds would be a disturbance that could introduce error.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.155
Finally, we have measurement noise.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:14.775
Measurement noise refers to the unpredictable errors introduced

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:19.844
whenever we try to measure something about the quad or its environment.

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:25.449
You will learn a lot more about noise in particular in the next course on estimation.
