00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.334
In the last lesson,

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.839
you learned about vehicle dynamics by studying

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.484
the effect of forces and torques on a bi-rotor.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.190
And this gave you some impressive predictive power.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.929
Given the state of the vehicle and the rotational rates of the two rotors,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.035
you could increment the state forward in time

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.920
to predict the trajectory of the vehicle in the future.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.595
Then, at the end of the lesson, you went the other way.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:29.477
Starting with a desire trajectory,

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:31.875
like vertical oscillations for example,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.744
you were able to determine what sequence of rotor commands would

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:40.274
actually cause the bi-rotor to fly in that trajectory.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.659
And if we lived in a perfect world,

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.929
a model of the vehicle dynamics would be all we need.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.899
It will tell us how to design vehicle inputs,

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.445
the motor turn rates,

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.605
that result in a desired motion,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.384
and the vehicle controls problem would be solved.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:56.844
In the real world,

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:01.698
the control problem is all about managing the messiness of the real world,

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:06.534
and making sure the vehicle achieves the task despite wind disturbances,

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:11.244
neglected aerodynamic effects and model parameter uncertainties.

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:16.930
For example, your estimate of the rotational inertia of the vehicle may be slightly off.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.835
In the next exercise,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.219
you'll explore one of the problems that can

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.769
arise when our knowledge of the vehicle is off,

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:25.629
by even just a little bit.
