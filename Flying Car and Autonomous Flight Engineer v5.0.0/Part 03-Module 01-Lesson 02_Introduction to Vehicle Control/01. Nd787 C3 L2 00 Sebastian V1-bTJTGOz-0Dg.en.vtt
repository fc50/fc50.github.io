00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
PID control is one of the most amazing techniques in all of robotics.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.735
I taught it many times at Stanford,

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.090
and for every student there was a before and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.285
after knowing about it, which was transformational.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.460
Let me explain PID in an example.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.080
Suppose you have a hovering drone,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.550
and just for the example,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.365
I'm going to restrict myself to one dimension,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.435
which is the vertical dimension, the z dimension.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.490
Suppose it's hovering right here,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.690
and your desire is to make it hover up here. What would you do?

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.150
Well, you could say there's a difference between

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.775
your current z value and the desired z value.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:36.305
So let's add thrust maybe in proportion to that difference.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.200
So drone will come up and accelerate.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.465
As it hits your target level,

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:43.760
it will unfortunately overshoot,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.710
and the reason why it overshoot is it has inertia,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.210
it can't just stop on the spot.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.750
Now your controller that you're [inaudible] when I say you're too high,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.205
the error is just reversed.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:53.660
So let's reduce thrust,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.450
and what you'll find is that your drone ends up oscillating.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.170
That's not good. What I just described is called a P controller,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.555
and P stands for proportional.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:08.520
PID stands for proportional, integration, and differentiation.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.605
So you're going to add additional terms to avoid the oscillation effect,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:17.260
in PID controller that can safely hover the drone at exactly the right level.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.870
PID control.
