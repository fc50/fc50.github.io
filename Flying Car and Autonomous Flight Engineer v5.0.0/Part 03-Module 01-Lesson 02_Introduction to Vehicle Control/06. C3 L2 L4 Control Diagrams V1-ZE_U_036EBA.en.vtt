00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.457
The controller you just worked with,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:05.430
its known as an open loop controller.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.880
An open loop controller is a controller that doesn't

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.101
receive any feedback from the system it's controlling,

00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:19.510
and this lack of feedback can make a simple control problem very difficult.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.800
As an example, consider getting out of bed in the morning,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840
and brushing your teeth.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.695
For you, this is probably not a hard problem to solve.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.870
But if you were told to do it by wearing a blindfold,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.720
it will probably be a lot harder. The lesson here,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.233
effective control requires feedback.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.229
In the world of control theory,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.575
we use block diagrams to visualize

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:52.130
important information about a controller and the system it controls.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.595
An open loop controller has a control diagram that looks like this.

00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:02.690
For the controller, you just work with the system, was the drone.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.975
The reference, was the target set location which was Z knot,

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.570
the input was the commanded thrust,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.090
and the output was eventually,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.610
the actual set location.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.355
In general, the output describes what we can measure about the system.

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:22.080
If we can measure the velocity,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.213
it would also include Z dot.

00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:27.000
And as you saw,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.420
this doesn't produce a very effective controller because it lacks feedback,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.320
which means, any errors will be unnoticed and are able to grow unchecked.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.361
To turn this into a closed loop controller,

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.210
we need a diagram that looks like this.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.410
And if you look down here,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.835
you'll see that we are using a sensor to measure the output of the system,

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:54.540
and we are feeding that measured signal back,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.280
and comparing it with the target value, the reference signal.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.058
This circular thing is called a summing junction,

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:05.140
and the plus and minus signs are used to indicate that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.970
the arrow which this junction produces comes from the reference,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.435
minus the measured output.

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:17.230
You might see these summing junctions in some of the control diagrams,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.890
but sometimes they are also just omitted.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.613
In these block diagrams,

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:27.390
arrows represent signals, and the boxes are functions or equations.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.000
For example, the system block represents our model equation.
