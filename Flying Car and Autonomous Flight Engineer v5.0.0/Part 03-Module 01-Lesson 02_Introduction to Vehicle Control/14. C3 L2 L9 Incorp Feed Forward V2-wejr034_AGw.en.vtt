00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Earlier in this lesson,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.815
you implemented a P controller which only knew

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:08.880
about the actual error of the vehicle's position.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.810
Just now, we implemented a PD controller

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.410
which also knew about the error in the vehicle's velocity,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.305
which is the first derivative of position.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.410
And there are many situations where PD control

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.670
is actually enough to track a reference trajectory.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.765
In the exercises you've seen in this lesson,

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:33.250
the targets has just been some constant set of value.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.075
But what about more interesting and realistic trajectories?

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:40.643
When the reference trajectory changes very rapidly,

00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:43.690
we can make our controller's job easier by telling it

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.250
the desired acceleration or second derivative of position as well.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.755
In this case, the control that we sent to the vehicle looks like this.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:59.470
And this acceleration term is usually called feed-forward term.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.848
In the ideal world,

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.420
z dot dot would move the vehicle along

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.905
the desired trajectory and e and e dot would be zero.

00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:10.665
We would need no control action.

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:15.540
So we can think of the commanded control as being centered around

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.705
the desired acceleration but pulled

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:23.310
either up or down by the errors in position and velocity.
