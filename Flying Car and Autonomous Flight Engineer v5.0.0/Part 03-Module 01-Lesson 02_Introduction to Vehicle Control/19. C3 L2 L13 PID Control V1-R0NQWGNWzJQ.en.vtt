00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
To correct for systematic bias,

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.919
we need a full PID controller.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.835
The I, in PID, stands for integral.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.175
And if you remember from calculus,

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.860
the integral of a function is the area under the curve.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:20.530
So, when you have an error function that looks like this one, well,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.500
the integral of this function from let's say,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
0 to 5, would be all of this area.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.700
And the integral from 0 to 10 would also include all of this area as well.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.205
The integral of an error like this over time,

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:39.570
is a very useful tool for accumulating error.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.225
And that's exactly what the item in the PID controller does.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.325
It accumulates error over time and then

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:51.460
adjusts the system to counter the accumulation of error.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.377
Mathematically, we can write the full PID controller equation like this,

00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:00.695
or reparameterized, we can write it like this.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.805
With this reparameterization, similar to the PID controller,

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:11.610
we just need to choose a damping ratio between 0.7 and 1 and decide on a time constant,

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.375
which is directly related to the raised time.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.704
This makes the tuning task so much more intuitive

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.484
compared to tuning these three independent parameters,

00:01:22.484 --> 00:01:26.105
Kp, Ki, and Kd.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.630
When we get this right,

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.729
the altitude will start to look more like this.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.750
As the integrated error accumulates,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.000
the vehicle is able to adjust its thrust until it reaches the target altitude.
