00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
We now have a notion of cost,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:05.955
a function that provides a measure of how good or bad a partial plan is.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.004
We can start to add in some guidance about how to make progress towards the goal.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.500
Given a map of the world,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.754
I can make a rough estimate of how far it is,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.260
or in other words, how much it's going to cost to get

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.060
from the last state in any given partial plan to the goal.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:21.599
In much the same way, you decide which way to go

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.650
when walking through the city on your way to your destination.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.299
There are a couple of common ways to do this.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.824
One example is estimating that the remaining cost to get to the goal,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:35.100
is the euclidean distance from the last state in the partial plan to the goal state.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.905
In our grid world, that looks like this.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.085
Now, the value in each cell is the euclidean distance to the goal,

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:45.395
or in other words, the square root of the sum of the square of the x and y distances.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.220
Such an estimate ignores obstacles,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.899
and is going to be an underestimate,

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.030
but it will tell you whether the last state in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.179
the partial plan is making progress towards the goal,

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.979
because progress means that the euclidean distance will get smaller and smaller.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.559
Similarly, if you're moving away from the goal,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.990
the euclidean distance will get larger.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.615
Another common choice is the so called Manhattan distance,

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:10.814
which is just the sum of the x and y distances remaining to get to the goal.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:14.879
The name comes from assuming you need to move through your grid based discritization,

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:17.560
like you would move through the city of Manhattan.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.609
Lineally along the streets to form square blocks.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.849
These distance estimates are what are known as heuristics,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:29.019
and they help tremendously in finding a solution to the planning problem efficiently.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:31.875
Your heuristic estimate doesn't have to be perfect,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.545
but it does need to have one important property,

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:39.375
which is that it does need to always be an underestimate of the true cost.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:44.060
This property of being an underestimate is known as being admissible.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.225
One way to ensure that your heuristic is admissible is to ignore obstacles,

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:52.219
which is to say ignore the cost of going around obstacles.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.852
The important thing about being at admissible heuristic,

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:59.459
is that if we incorporate the heuristic into our notion of the total cost of a plan,

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.250
they will never ignore plans or fail to expand plans,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.230
because we overestimated their cost,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.825
which ensures that we'll always find the lowest cost plan from start to goal.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:11.149
We've got a cost function and a heuristic.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.000
It's time to combine them to solve our planning problem.
