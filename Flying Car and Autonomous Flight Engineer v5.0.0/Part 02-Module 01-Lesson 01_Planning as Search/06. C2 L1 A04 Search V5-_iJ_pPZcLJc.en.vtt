00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Okay, I've said that in our simple grid world example,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.580
a plan is a sequence of states from the start state to the goal state.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.599
How do I build that plan?

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.974
The process of building a plan is the essence of the search process.

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:16.649
The way that I'm going to conduct a search is by taking a partial plan,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.750
applying an action, and adding

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.115
the resulting state to the end of the previous plan to get a new partial plan.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.109
Let's look at an example.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.890
Imagine that we have a simple 2D grid world

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.570
and we have a start state and we have a goal state.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.740
And we start with a very simple initial plan of just being at the start state.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.395
One state sequence is still a sequence.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:41.560
Now, let's imagine that I only have one possible action which is to move right,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.300
and so I always apply the same action.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.859
I take my initial partial plan of being at the start state,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.269
and I move right and end up here.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.179
That's a new partial plan.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.854
It doesn't get me all the way to the goal but it is a partial plan.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.579
Let's do the same thing over again.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.379
Apply my action, I end up with this state.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.945
Now, I have a new partial plan.

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:02.935
Start, right, right.

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:07.510
I do that a couple more times and I end up with a plan that looks like start state,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.715
right, right, right Goals state.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.120
That's a successful plan.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.910
Now, it's a silly plan because I only ever considered moving right.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.765
And I got lucky that I didn't have to turn or go around any obstacles.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:21.375
The next thing we want to look at is,

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.000
how do we incorporate the other actions that we might need to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.670
take in order to get more complicated plans,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.000
and plans that move around obstacles?
