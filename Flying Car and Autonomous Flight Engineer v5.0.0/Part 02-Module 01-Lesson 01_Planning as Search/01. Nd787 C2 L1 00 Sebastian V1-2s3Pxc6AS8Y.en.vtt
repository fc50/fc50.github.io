Welcome to 3D motion planning.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.780
It's all about a drone finding it's way about it's environment.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.430
In the beginning we are going to cheat a little bit and start in

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.820
2D, learning about an algorithm called A star search.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.080
Later, we're going to analyze this into 3D so drones find their way around.
