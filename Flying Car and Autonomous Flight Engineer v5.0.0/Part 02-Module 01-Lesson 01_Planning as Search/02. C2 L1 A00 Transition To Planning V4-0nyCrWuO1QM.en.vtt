00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
In the last project, you implemented

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.835
event-driven programming to control a quadrotor in simulation.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.450
You gave your quad a set of instructions to follow: takeoff,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.055
assent to a particular altitude,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.410
fly a specific path, then land.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.200
In doing this, you executed your first flight plan.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.960
Nice work. Now, we're going to dive into

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.840
the details of constructing more complicated flight plans.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.650
And in the next project, you'll implement a motion planning algorithm that allows you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.020
to automatically generate a flight plan using a 3D map of the world.
