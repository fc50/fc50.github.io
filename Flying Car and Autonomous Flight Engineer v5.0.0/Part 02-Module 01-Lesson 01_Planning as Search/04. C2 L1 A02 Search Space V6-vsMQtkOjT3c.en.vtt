00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.362
Before your flying car can embark on a mission to pick up or drop off passengers,

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.842
it needs to have a plan.

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:10.110
A plan is really a series of actions that your vehicle must take in order to safely

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.502
and efficiently move from some initial location to some goal location.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.595
Or, more generally, to transform the initial state into the goal state.

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's consider a case where your flying car is at

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.295
the start location and you'd like to find a path to

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.530
a goal location and there are obstacles and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.180
other things like no fly zones that you need to avoid along the way.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.740
One way to think of a path from start to goal would be as

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.090
a continuous curve through their free space between the obstacles.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.670
If you think about the infinitely many decisions the vehicle would need to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.028
make along a flight path to follow any continuous curve to the goal,

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:48.070
the number of possible different action plans becomes infinitely large very quickly.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.315
When it comes to solving the planning problem,

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.855
you will often be faced with constraints in terms of time and computational resources,

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.080
such that the real goal is not to find the perfect solution,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.935
but rather to come up with a reasonable solution in a reasonable amount of time.

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:06.900
This is why your choice of representation of the problem, or in other words,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.235
choosing the right search space is key to solving the problem as efficiently as possible.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:16.025
So let's talk more about just what goes into choosing a representation.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.250
Since reasoning about all the possible continuous curves from

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.965
start to goal would be super complicated, unnecessarily complicated,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.335
we need a way to recast the problem and the natural way to do this,

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.095
as you would with most any computational problem,

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:35.631
is to break the continuous universe up into a finite set of discrete states.

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.748
Rather than describing our vehicle's path as a smooth curve,

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:40.790
we'll describe it as a series of states

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.800
the vehicle must pass through to get from start to goal.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.810
Sometimes this is just a regular grid.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.790
Sometimes there are more exotic ways to define

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.595
the states unevenly across the state space.

00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:52.710
The definition of states only gets us

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.795
part of the way toward a representation of the problem.

00:01:55.795 --> 00:02:00.665
We must also define actions which describe how the vehicle moves from state to state.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.370
We'll see shortly that the choice of

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.670
state space and action space are really closely connected.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.050
And to each type of action,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.270
we must assign a cost which describes

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.990
how desirable or easy actions are relative to one another.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.860
In summary, to represent your planning problem and define your search space,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460
you must have the following.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.175
First, a set of all possible states in which a vehicle might find itself in the world.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.180
Next, you need a start state and a goal state.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.080
You also need to know the set of actions that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.800
allow the vehicle to move from one state to the next.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.705
And finally, you need to assign a cost to each possible action.

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:39.000
And there you have it, a representation of your planning problem and your search space.
