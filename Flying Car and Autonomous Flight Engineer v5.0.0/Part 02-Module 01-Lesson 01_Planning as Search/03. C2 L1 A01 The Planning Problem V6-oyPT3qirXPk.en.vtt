00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
Planning is a core capability of any autonomous vehicle.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.273
But in reality, it's also central to your everyday life.

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:09.240
Before you leave your house to go somewhere, you make a plan.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
In many cases, it might not even occur to you that you've made a plan.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.820
But, in fact, throughout the day,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.490
you're coming up with a detailed series of actions you need

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.355
to take to get from wherever you are to wherever you're going.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.740
Flying cars operate in much the same way.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.850
Suppose your flying car is located somewhere in the city and

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.020
is tasked with flying to some other location or series of locations.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.885
Before setting out, it needs to make a plan,

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.210
which will require making decisions about

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.640
which path to take based on where obstacles or

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.795
no fly zones are and any other factors you want to take into account.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:47.145
For example, you might want your flying car to focus on fuel efficiency,

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:52.455
or speed, or maybe even take the smoothest possible path to ensure passenger comfort.

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:55.470
Even more complicated, the flying car

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.410
might not know everything about the state of the world ahead of time.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.690
A good planner might consider

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.935
possible contingencies and take various uncertainties into account.

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:09.825
Finally, there's more to planning than simply navigating and finding motion plans.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.291
For example, for delivery vehicles,

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:15.253
there are decisions to be made about what order to make deliveries,

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.770
when to return home for fuel, and so on.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.475
In this module, we'll focus on the 3D motion planning problem.

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:25.180
But in later modules, we'll look at these higher level mission planning problems.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.270
All of these things taken together form the planning problem.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.576
And at the end of the day,

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:31.480
solving the planning problem mostly comes

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.135
down to setting up what's known as your search space,

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:37.020
and then conducting a search through that space.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.025
In this module, I'll be showing you how to represent

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:44.765
the 3D motion planning problem and how to conduct a search to find a viable plan.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:49.130
We'll start off by solving some relatively simple two-dimensional planning problems,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.330
and we'll talk about different ways to solve these problems efficiently.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.720
However, 3D motion planning makes us think

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.050
about how we actually represent the vehicle and the world,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.705
and we'll look at different representations.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.930
Air vehicles often have complex dynamics.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.120
They can't always move in arbitrary ways.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.350
And we'll look at putting the dynamic constraints of the vehicle into the planner.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.450
Finally, we'll examine some practical considerations to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.945
keep in mind when executing a plan within a finite state machine.

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:20.490
At the end of these lessons,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.010
you'll get to test your skills by implementing

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.540
a 3D path planning algorithm for your quadcopter.
