00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
Before I can incorporate any guidance about how to make useful progress towards the goal,

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.650
I need to add the notion of a cost function to my search process.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.890
Up to this point,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.415
I have assumed that every action had the same cost,

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.469
and I've been assuming that the length of

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.245
the plan was exactly the same thing as the cost of a plan.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.095
But that might not be the case.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.535
Some actions might actually cost more than others.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.500
For instance, in our grid example,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.289
you've seen plans that consist of motions moving right,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.359
left, up, and down.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210
But what about diagonal actions?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.295
Well, in the simplest sense,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:34.800
a diagonal motion on a grid traverses a distance of square root two,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:38.789
compared to lateral and vertical motions that traverse a distance of one.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.439
We could say that in this case,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.089
diagonal motions have a cost of root two.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.190
With a cost function,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.085
which is really just the cost associated with all the actions and a partial plan,

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:53.100
I can add up these costs and use them as a way to compare different plans.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.195
If my ultimate goal is to find the lowest cost plan as part of a search process,

00:00:57.195 --> 00:01:01.034
then instead of expanding the shortest plan or the most recent plan,

00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:04.090
I could be thinking about expanding the lowest cost plan.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.530
This particular algorithm is called uniform cost and it's guaranteed

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.730
to find the lowest cost plan first as part of the search process.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.010
Next, we'll look at how to incorporate your map

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.000
of the environment in guiding the search process.
