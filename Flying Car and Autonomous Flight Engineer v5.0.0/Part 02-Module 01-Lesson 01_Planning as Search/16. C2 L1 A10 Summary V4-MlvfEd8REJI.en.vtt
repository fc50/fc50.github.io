00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
In this lesson, we covered the foundations of solving the planning problem.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
You looked at how to set up your search space which involve discretizing the world

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
into a set of individual states with a start and goal state for your vehicle.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.855
You defined actions that describe how your vehicle moves from state to state.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.635
And finally, you assigned a cost to each action that describes how

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.630
difficult or complex each action is relative to all the others.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.695
After that, we looked at heuristics for estimating

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.520
the total cost remaining from the last state of a partial plan to the goal.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.140
With a cost function and a heuristic that was both admissible and consistent in hand,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.930
you implemented the famous A* algorithm to

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.005
utilize a map of the world to make your search more efficient.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.090
These concepts are really at the heart of

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.750
any autonomous system when it comes to solving the planning problem,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.120
but this is just the beginning.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570
Next up, we'll be looking at how to represent your vehicle within

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.380
the search space and other clever ways of discretizing your world.
