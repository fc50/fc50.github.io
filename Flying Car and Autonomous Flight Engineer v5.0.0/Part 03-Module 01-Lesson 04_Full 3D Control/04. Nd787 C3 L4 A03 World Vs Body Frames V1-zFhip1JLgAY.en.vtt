00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
In 3D, we are going to do the same general sequence of steps to keep track

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.769
of the vehicle state but with slight modifications to keep track of rotations.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.879
Remember we also call this attitude of the vehicle.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.589
So, to do this,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.570
we are going to need to think in two different coordinate systems,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.010
something you saw in the Motion Planning Course.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.510
The first is the world frame which is fixed in the world and

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.895
the other one is the body frame and that is attached to the quadrotor.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.045
And as a reminder, when we look at the quad from above,

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.399
the body frame x-axis goes from the center of

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.054
the vehicle out between the two forward propellers.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:47.159
The y axis then points to the right and

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.959
the z axis goes into the screen which would be down.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.829
And the thing that makes 3D more difficult is keeping track of these two frames.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.479
Especially when we have to do mass inside of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.799
the rotating frame and then convert those rotations into

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.929
Euler angles in the world frame

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.520
because ultimately we want to control the drone in the world frame.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:14.140
But we get some of our sensor measurements from the IMU which

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.269
measures turn rates in the body frame and our controls,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.450
especially the moments that we command,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.140
have a much more intuitive interpretation when we reason in the body frame.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.905
Because of this, we really have no choice but to think

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:33.260
both in the world frame at some times and in the body frame at others.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.600
So, let's go through the steps we outlined for 2D and make some additions and changes.
