00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
You would want to implement and tune the body rate control at first.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.625
Once you could rely on that controller to hit

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:12.294
its roll-pitch yaw rate commands, then implement roll-pitch.

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:13.890
To do that in practice,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.179
you manually control the thrust to roughly counteract gravity.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:24.164
Then, you implement the altitude controller because it's so critical to avoid crashes.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:28.059
And finally, you implement the lateral position controller.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.349
The majority of the rest of this lesson will involve

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.700
filling out and tuning the rest of these control loops.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.990
The order we would ideally go in is: first, body rate; next,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.560
pitch-roll; then yaw, and after that,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.054
altitude, and finally, lateral position.

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:50.070
But you already saw the pitch-roll controller,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.539
so the order will adjust slightly.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.384
Each of these controllers will be presented in isolation,

00:00:56.384 --> 00:01:01.174
and you'll be asked to implement a working solution for each of them.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:04.469
We'll also be providing solutions for each,

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.640
but I highly recommend you implement

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.474
your own working controller at each step before looking at the solution.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:15.519
If you do get really stuck, consult the solution,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.619
understand it, and then go back and implement it yourself.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.344
Even when you do get a working solution on your own,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:28.765
you should also compare your version to the solution and note any differences.

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.500
This will also be a great opportunity to ask questions,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.390
compare code, and discuss the material in the Nanodegree's Slack channels.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.290
For the Python portion of the final project,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.670
you will be combining these into a single file which will control a simulated 3D quad.
