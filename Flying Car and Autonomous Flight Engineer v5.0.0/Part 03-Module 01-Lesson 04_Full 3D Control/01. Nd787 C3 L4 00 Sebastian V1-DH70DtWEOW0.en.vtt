00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
So now we're going to torture you a bit more,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.070
and putting many things together.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.550
You learned about rotational matrices in all angles,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.545
you learned about Vehicle Physics,

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.585
and you learned about PID control.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.150
So now we're going to put all this math together.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.780
You're going to build a real physical model of a real drone,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.650
and then you're going to use PID control to control that drone,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.464
and the only footnote I have is by the math gets involved,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.160
it is actually nothing really new here.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.490
You're just putting these pieces together into a single system.
