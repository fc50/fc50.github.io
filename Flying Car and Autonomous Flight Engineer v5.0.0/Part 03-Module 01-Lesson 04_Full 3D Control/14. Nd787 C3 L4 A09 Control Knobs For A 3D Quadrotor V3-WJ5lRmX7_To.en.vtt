00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
So, finally after understanding the 3D dynamics of a quadrotor,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
we can now think about controlling the vehicle.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.690
Lots of the ideas that we saw for

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.395
the 2D quad control are essential for 3D controller as well.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:19.875
For example, we use the same cascaded PD or PID control structure.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.280
We also need a non-linear transformation in order to

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.775
translate target accelerations to motor forces and torques.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:31.720
Let's look at the 2D control from last lesson.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.090
A drone flying in the vertical plane with two propellers was an under actuated system.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.760
This meant we could only choose two quantities we wanted to control,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.400
and then we have to use the dynamics to design a control knob for those quantities.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.815
For the 2D quad we wanted control knobs that could control Y and Z motion.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:57.085
Our control knob for Z was the thrust.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:01.900
In the non-linear case we had to increase the thrust when the vehicle was tilted.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.640
Our control knob for Y was less immediate.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.210
We had to first design a controller that linked phi to Y motion,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.300
and then we designed a controller that linked the differential thrust to phi.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.660
In 3D, we want control over X, Y and Z.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.185
So, we can move the quad where we want it in space.

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:28.060
Then we typically choose yaw as our fourth controllable state variable.
