00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
Welcome back. In the first three lessons of this course,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.010
you've learned about quadrotor dynamics and quadrotor control in one and two dimensions.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.710
And remember what it means to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.880
understand the dynamics of a quadrotor.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.950
It means that when we know the forces and the moments that are acting on the vehicle,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.155
we can predict what the state of the vehicle will be in the future.

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:23.150
That's right. And understanding the dynamics is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.740
really helpful for solving the problem of vehicle control.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.600
When we solve a control's problem,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.945
we go the other way.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:35.540
We start with the desired motion and then we determine what forces and moments we need to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.430
command to the vehicle based on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.435
our current knowledge of the state of the vehicle compared to the target state.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.920
And in this lesson, you're going to complete two major tasks.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.120
First, you're going to model the dynamics of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.620
a 3D quadrotor by implementing an advanced state function.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.140
And once you've modeled the dynamics,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.510
you'll learn how to solve the problem of three-dimensional control of a quadrotor.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.275
Now, this lesson won't require introducing any brand new controls concepts,

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:07.770
but some of the math is going to get a little trickier than it's been up till now.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.065
But I promise, it will all be worth it.

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:12.005
Because at the end of this lesson,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:17.460
you will be able to design a full controller that can actually control a real quadrotor.
