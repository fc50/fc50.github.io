00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Just like we did in 2D,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.015
we need to keep track of our vehicle's state,

00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:08.905
but this time, we need 12 variables instead of six.

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:13.980
These variables specify the location of the vehicle as x, y, and z.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
They specify the orientation of the vehicle in Euler angles, for roll,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
pitch, and yaw, which we abbreviate with phi, theta, and psi.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.530
We use Euler angles here because they are intuitive.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.720
But we could equally use quaternions, for example,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.515
or any other representation that describes orientation.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:39.160
The 12 state variables also specify that x,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.925
y, and z velocities,

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.610
which shouldn't be a surprise.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.355
And then finally, they need to specify rotation rates.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.280
For the 2D case,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.325
that was a single quantity phi-dot.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:57.570
In 3D, we must consider rotation rates about all three axes.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.140
We will call them the body rates of the vehicle and the name is p, q,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.710
r. Now, the important thing to note is that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.945
these are not the same as phi-dot, theta-dot, and psi-dot.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.630
And that's because the Euler angles phi,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.830
theta, and psi are world frame coordinates.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.880
To be precise, they describe the rotations

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.085
necessary to rotate the world frame into the body frame.

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.560
By the p, q, r variables,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.300
give the angular rate of change of the vehicle in the body frame of the vehicle.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.510
So p, q, r are the turn rates about the body x,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.010
y, and z axis, respectively.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.290
These are the rotational velocities that would be

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.120
measured by a gyroscope mounted on the vehicle itself.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.065
It turns out, it is easier to work with p, q,

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.375
r than it is to work with Euler angle rates.

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:57.920
So tracking vehicles data looks similar in 2D and 3D with this one exception: p,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.155
q, r are not the derivatives of phi, theta, and psi.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.065
Next, we have step two,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:10.065
figure out the forces and movements acting on the vehicle in the body frame.

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:14.590
Remember, these forces come from the rotation of the motors,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.560
and in a body fixed frame,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.835
the location of the motors are fixed which is to desirable.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:24.290
All four motor forces point up in the frame of the body.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.200
The net force in the body frame will be

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660
the collective thrust from

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.105
the four rotors and it will be negative in the z direction,

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:35.855
since down is positive and up is negative.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.625
The net torque should be easy to calculate in the body frame as well,

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:44.670
because the orientation or attitude of the vehicle doesn't matter.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.240
At this point, we have two separate mathematical paths we have to take.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.560
We have to figure out translational motion from the forces,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.940
and then on a separate path,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.940
we are going to consider how the moments influenced the rotational motion,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.245
that will be a little trickier.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.870
So we've got three things on our to-do

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.675
list before we can really solve the 3D dynamics case.

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:14.260
One, figure out exactly how four propeller turn rates,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.385
turn into a net force and three moments.

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:22.965
Two, track the influence of force on translational motion.

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:28.510
And three, track the influence of the three moments on rotational motion.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.650
We will walk through the first two in programming activities,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.150
and then we'll come back for a bit more explanation about number three.
