00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
Hopefully, you were able to use this equation along with the moments

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:08.390
and the moment of inertial matrix to calculate omega-dot.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.135
You could then perform an integration of this omega-dot to figure out what the new p,

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.794
q, r all were.

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:21.960
This is analogous to using the linear accelerations to update the linear velocities,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.679
and this means that nine of our 12 variables have been updated.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.960
We are almost there.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.280
All that's left is to update our Euler angles phi, theta, and psi.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.658
Now unfortunately, this is not just a straightforward integration.

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.774
As I mentioned earlier, p, q,

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.879
r are not the same as phi-dot, theta-dot,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.790
and psi-dot, so we can't directly integrate

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740
them and we have one last tricky bit of math to do.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.370
We'll link to papers that explore this math in detail,

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.149
but the equation we care about is this.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.289
And conceptually, what this equation does is relates

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.340
an instantaneous turn rate in the body frame to

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.895
an instantaneous change in the Euler angles.

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.354
And note that we are using Euler angles under the hood

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:16.575
because they have a more intuitive interpretation than quaternions.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.760
If you use a different attitude representation,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.040
this above equation would change,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.660
but would essentially do the same thing going from

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.189
rotation rates in the body frame to turn rates in the build frame.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.079
And once again, you don't need to memorize these equations,

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.724
but when you work in this field,

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.629
and you see equations like this,

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.694
you now know why we need them,

00:01:39.694 --> 00:01:42.299
and you should be able to implement them.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.244
It's also important that you remember that these equations exist.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:49.645
The dynamics of a quadrotor are pretty well understood.

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:54.299
And before you try throwing machine learning or neural networks and control problems,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.719
it's usually helpful to first consult the physics.
