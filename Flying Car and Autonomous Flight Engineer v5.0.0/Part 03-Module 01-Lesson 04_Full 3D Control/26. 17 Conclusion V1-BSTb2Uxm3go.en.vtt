00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
In this lesson, you've seen how we can break

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.380
a complex controls problem into a sequence of first and second order systems.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.390
And you've seen that second order systems can be controlled

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.480
with PD or with PID controllers.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.230
You've also seen how a second order system can

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.679
sometimes be controlled with two cascaded P controllers,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.100
which each control a separate first order system.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650
And in both cases,

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.289
there are going to be some physically meaningful parameters

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.259
that we can tune to adjust the behavior of the system.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.715
These ideas of cascaded control and first and second order systems apply in 2D as well.

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.185
The main thing that changed in going from

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:43.925
two to three dimensions was how we had to think about attitude and rotations.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.765
That's right. In three dimensions,

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.375
we really have to think in both the body frame and the world frame,

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.850
and converting between the two introduces

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.520
a mathematical complexity that controller just has to handle.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.890
And just now, you saw how to use way points generated by

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.210
a 3D motion planner as input to a 3D quadrotor controller.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.994
That means that you are ready for the final project for this course.

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:09.660
And this is a big deal.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.715
Once you've completed this project,

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.049
you'll have implemented a large portion of

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.759
the full stack of a flying vehicle. Congratulations.
