00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Congratulations!

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.165
I hope you enjoyed implementing each of those control loops.

00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:07.924
At this point, you may have noticed that

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:11.705
these controllers seem to work with wide range of parameters.

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.085
Specifically, you may have noticed that

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:19.230
really aggressive proportional gains always seemed to make the controller perform better.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.949
The reason you may have noticed this has to do with some of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890
the practical considerations we've

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.315
ignored in the quadrotor model you've been controlling.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:33.689
So far, we've been assuming that the rotors can generate infinite thrust,

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.699
generate upward and downward thrust,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.935
and instantaneously change thrust.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.255
If rotors could really do that,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:46.355
then any time the quadrotor deviated from the target trajectory,

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:48.559
the vehicle could instantly command

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.910
whatever massive force of torque was required to immediately correct itself.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.589
In reality, all of these assumptions are wrong.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.275
In reality, the motors have a minimum and maximum thrust that they can produce.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:07.084
And the minimum thrust is a small positive number.

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:08.909
What that means is,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.359
that the motors on a quad can only generate thrust in one direction.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.030
Additionally, they have a minimum and maximum rate

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.280
at which they can change the thrust that they produce.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.379
Parameter tuning becomes much more important

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.739
when these actuation constraints are taken into account.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:28.670
In part of the final project,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.840
you will get to work with a vehicle model that isn't quite

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.895
as forgiving as the model you have been working with in this lesson.

00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:38.254
In fact, in the real world,

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:42.339
gains that are too high can actually cause instability.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.409
Be on the lookout for this as you implement the final project.
