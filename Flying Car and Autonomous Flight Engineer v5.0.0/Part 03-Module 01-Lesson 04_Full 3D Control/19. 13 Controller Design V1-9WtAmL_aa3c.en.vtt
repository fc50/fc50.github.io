00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
The roll-pitch controller is

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:05.565
the most mathematically involved controller in this architecture.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.900
We covered it first because we wanted to stay focused

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.470
on the math associated with 3D rotations.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.515
But this isn't the first controller you would implement

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.795
if you were actually implementing this architecture from scratch.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.520
The sequence you would want to take would be to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.820
implement and tune the inner control loops first.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.589
Remember, these inner loops generally

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.420
operate on a faster time scale than the outer loops.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
So if you were just looking at the position controller,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.545
roll-pitch controller and body-rate controller,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:45.310
what sequence would you want to implement these controllers in?
