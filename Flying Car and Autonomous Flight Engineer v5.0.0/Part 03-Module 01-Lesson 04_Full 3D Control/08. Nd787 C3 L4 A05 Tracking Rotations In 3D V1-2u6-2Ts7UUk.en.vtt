00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.565
You've seen how to go from rotor rotation rates to controls.

00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:08.020
And you've seen how those controls can be thought of

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.830
as a single collective thrust and three differential thrusts,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.945
which have torques about the three rotation axes.

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:17.970
You've seen how to use the collective thrust,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.015
a rotation matrix, and

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:24.470
two type integrals to advance the translational motion of the vehicle.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.145
Now, it's time to use the differential thrusts to advance the rotational motion.

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.465
Let me walk you through how we're going to do that.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:36.710
First, we are going to use Euler's equation to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.260
calculate the rotational acceleration of the vehicle in its own body frame.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.850
Next, we're going to integrate that rotational acceleration to find the new p,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.030
q, r rotational velocities of the vehicle in its own frame.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.000
Then, we're going to use some clever math to convert

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.825
the rotational velocity in the body frame to a phi-dot,

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.540
theta-dot, and psi-dot in the build frame.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.170
Finally, we will integrate these quantities to get

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.085
the final Euler angle orientation of the vehicle in the world frame.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:13.050
Depending on what representation of attitude you use,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.670
the last set may look slightly different.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.210
But in any case, we need to translate

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.920
body rotation rates into world frame attitude representation.
