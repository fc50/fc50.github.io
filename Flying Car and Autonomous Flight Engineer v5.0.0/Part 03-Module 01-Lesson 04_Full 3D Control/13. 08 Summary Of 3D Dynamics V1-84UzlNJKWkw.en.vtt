00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
If you were able to implement all of the methods in this section on your own,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.464
congratulations, because this math wasn't trivial.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.195
If you needed to consult the solutions, that's okay too.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.080
But either way, hopefully,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.429
you saw that the maths gets more complicated when you transition to three dimensions.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.094
This will become easier with experience and practice.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.640
But I want to point out,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.245
that trying to implement and code an equation that's given to you

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:33.390
in math is something you will have to do when working in this field.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.954
As you move to different vehicle designs,

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:38.489
or work on different systems within a vehicle,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.750
you'll likely have to acquaint yourself with a new domain by reading

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.219
papers and trying to reimplement something

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.155
that someone has already described mathematically.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.484
For example, in the second half of the Nanodegree,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.990
you'll learn about fixed wing aircraft,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.070
and you'll find that while most of the controls concepts still apply,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.380
some of the details of the dynamics will change.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.215
So, with this in mind,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.680
as we transition into full three-dimensional control,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.210
we will also be introducing you to some technical papers

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.299
from the field and asking you to read sections of these papers.
