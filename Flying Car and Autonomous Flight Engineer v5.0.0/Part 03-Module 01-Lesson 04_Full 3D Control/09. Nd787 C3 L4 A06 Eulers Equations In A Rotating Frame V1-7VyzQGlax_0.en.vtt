00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.234
In lesson one, you saw the following equation.

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:08.584
And this equation says that a moment will cause a rotational acceleration.

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:14.509
And in this equation, all of these variables are just plain scalar numbers.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.894
In three dimensions, this equation changes.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:24.550
Note that this omega here is a length three vector with the three rotation rates.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.560
And M is a length three vector giving moments about the x,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.809
y, and z axis.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.579
And the I term is a three by three inertia matrix summarizing all moments of inertia.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.539
This is a nice equation but unfortunately,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.030
it is only valid if we work in the world frame.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.520
And it turns out that there are lots of

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.700
mathematical reasons why we don't want to work in the world frame for the step.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.185
Namely, we want to calculate accelerations in the body frame.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:58.245
Remember, all of our moments are relative to the body frame,

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:02.419
and our gyros measure rotation rates about the body frames axis.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.579
And this moment of inertia is only a nice constant in diagonal matrix in the body frame.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.149
So, to get a version of this equation where torques and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
moments of inertia are expressed in the body frame,

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.879
we need to add some mathematical complexity.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.949
And now, when we work in the body frame,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.945
we have this additional term which you can read as omega cross I omega.

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:32.734
And this cross operation is a way of multiplying vectors called the cross product.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:36.280
The details of the cross product, I explained below.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.379
But honestly, any matrix math library has a cross product function you can simply call.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.359
Now, at this point,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.739
you might be feeling a little overwhelmed by math.

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:53.544
And understand that everything we are talking about right now really is math and physics.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:56.745
And it's incredibly useful math and physics

00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:00.579
because it tells us how our quad moves in three-dimensions.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.329
It tells us what a quad can and cannot do.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.319
But the details of this math and physics are beyond the scope of this course.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.560
So for now, understand that you don't need to memorize these equations.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.409
The important thing is that you can implement them, when you need to.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.740
And now you will do exactly that.
