00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
In the control module,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.139
we assume we know the position,

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.309
velocity, orientation, and rotation rate of the vehicle.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.669
If you look back to our 3D control diagram,

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.589
you can see how some of these quantities they use in the various control loops.

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.094
The role pitch controller for example,

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:22.149
relied on knowledge of the vehicle altitude,

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:26.584
and the body rate controller relied on knowledge of the body rates.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:29.414
But where do these quantities come from?

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:31.339
As you'll see in this lesson,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.155
they must be either measured directly,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.079
or calculated from measured quantities.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.170
To make these measurements, we need sensors.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.980
Quadrotors are gripped with multiple complimentary sensors,

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.069
and the sensors that you'll find on the quadrotor

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.105
are often the same sensors you'll find in your smartphone.

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.959
So for example, my phone has cameras,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.594
it has a GPS sensor,

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:01.244
accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors,

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.504
and even temperature sensors.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:06.975
And all of these sensors are used in drones.

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:10.424
So, if you added four motors to your phone,

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.569
it would be able to fly.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.979
In fact, the development of small and affordable sensors for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.689
smartphones really helped open the door for better and low cost drones.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.230
So let's quickly go over each of these sensors.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.840
First, we have gyroscopes.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.520
Gyroscopes measure rotational rates of the vehicle in

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:38.754
the body frame and they update at a very high rate usually at a few kilohertz.

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:41.604
Next, we have accelerometers.

00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:45.299
And these actually don't measure acceleration directly,

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.644
but measure something called specific acceleration,

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:51.045
which we'll talk about more later.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:55.519
These also operate at a very high rate up to a few kilohertz.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:58.890
Then, we have a magnetometer or compass,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.965
which gives us orientation in inertial frame

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:06.030
using the magnetic field of the Earth at about 100 hertz.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.259
The GPS is a very important sensor for outdoor flight,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.084
and it measures not only position, but also velocity,

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:18.840
and it does so at low rates;10 hertz is a standard sensor these days.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.955
Then we have the barometer,

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.550
which measures air pressure to infer

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.960
altitude which is a direction that is not as accurate in.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.770
And the barometer operates at about a 100 hertz.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.390
There are more sensors that could eventually go on a flying vehicle,

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.429
but these are really essential.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.510
The challenging part is correctly using all of the sensors to

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:47.359
measure or infer the 12 state variables of a flying vehicle.
