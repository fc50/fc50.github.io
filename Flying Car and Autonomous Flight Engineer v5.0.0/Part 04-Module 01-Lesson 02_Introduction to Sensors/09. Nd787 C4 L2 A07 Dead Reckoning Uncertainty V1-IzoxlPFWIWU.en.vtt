00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
How does our uncertainty estimate propagate?

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:07.529
We know how accurately we can measure the turn rate,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.919
but what does that mean for our angle estimates?

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.699
So, if we use a very basic integration scheme,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.629
and we neglect that we have additional integration error epsilon,

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:23.924
how does the noise in the turn rate measurements affect our angle estimates?

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.859
We can go step-by-step through that.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.009
For example, Theta at time one is equal to our initial Theta,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.945
plus our measured turn rate,

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.704
which is the true turn rate, Omega zero,

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:42.364
plus some noise representation Eta zero times delta t. So,

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.385
if we go through the equation,

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:47.549
we see that Theta one is corrupted by

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.559
some noise that has a variance of Sigma square, delta t square,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
and that's because if I have a Gaussian or

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.730
any random variable and I multiply it by a number,

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.279
the variance is the original variance,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.155
times the number squared.

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:07.109
So, this tells us how the noise in

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.864
the turn rate measurement translates into noise in the angle estimate,

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.935
and then, we can continue that for Theta two.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:23.314
If we do that, we see that the noise variance in the angle is two times delta t square,

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:29.334
Sigma square, because now we have Eta zero, plus Eta one.

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:32.324
Assuming these are independent,

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:36.600
the variances of those two random variables add.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.228
So, the overall variance doubles,

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:44.189
and then with every step, it increases.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.685
So, if you look at the nth time step Theta n,

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:52.480
then our variance related to our estimate of Theta n

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.784
is n times delta t square, times Sigma square.

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:02.129
That means that our uncertainty about our angle estimate grows over time.

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.060
Of course, we can reduce this uncertainty by taking

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.990
fossil measurements which will lower delta t. But this n means that no matter what we do,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.920
the uncertainty will have to grow with time.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:22.679
Now, I can make a plot of angle on the vertical axis and show that over time.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.319
If we assumes zero turn rate,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.185
then our angle will be constant over time.

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:32.278
But because we have measurement noise in our turn rate measurement,

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:35.259
the uncertainty envelope cross,

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:40.034
and plotted like this as a plus minus three Sigma envelope,

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:45.419
you can see that the width of this uncertainty grows with the square root of time.

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.534
So, this is really problematic because over time, our uncertainty grows.

00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:54.930
Which means our knowledge of the true angle decreases.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.230
Luckily, there are some other techniques that we can

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.949
use to tame this increasing uncertainty.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.129
But if you use dead-reckoning alone,

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.960
you will always have this growing uncertainty.
