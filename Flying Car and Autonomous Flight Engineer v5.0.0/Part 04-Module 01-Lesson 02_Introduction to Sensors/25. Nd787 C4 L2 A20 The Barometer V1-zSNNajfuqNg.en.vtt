00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
The last sensor I want to talk about is the barometer.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.550
The barometer can give very precise measurements of altitude,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.225
but these measurements are highly susceptible to drift.

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:16.559
Because of this, the barometer is a good compliment to the GPS,

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.309
which makes noisy but drift-free measurements of altitude.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.479
So how does a barometer actually measure altitude?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.085
Well, the barometer doesn't actually measure altitude directly.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:33.674
Instead, a barometer works by measuring atmospheric pressure.

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:38.125
Atmospheric pressure decreases in a predictable way with altitude.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:43.454
And this means that a measurement of pressure can be used as an estimate of height.

00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:47.210
And barometers are small and inexpensive.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.859
You can buy one for about a dollar.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.575
And if you'll look into a MEMS barometer,

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.780
they are really pretty simple.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.255
Basically, you have two metal plates that are separated by a vacuum gap.

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:05.049
Air pressure pushes down on the upper plate and this causes

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.530
deformations which cause the electrical capacitance of the two plates to change.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.500
We can measure this change in capacitance.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.084
And from that, we can know the air pressure.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:22.619
Here, you can see a PCB with a GPS and accelerometer,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.025
a gyroscope, a compass, and a barometer.

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:28.140
And in the middle of the barometer,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.689
you can see there's a tiny hole.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.569
That hole is there so air can get in and push against the plate.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.514
You can imagine that it would be pretty easy to corrupt

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:44.430
the measurements the sensor makes by blowing into this hole.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.985
So we have to be careful to avoid propeller down wash

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:51.795
and wind as sources of error we use a barometer.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.965
This is done by properly shielding the sensor.

00:01:55.965 --> 00:02:01.064
So how do we use measurements of air pressure to get altitude?

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:07.590
This equation is the atmospheric model we use to get altitude from a barometer.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.909
h_b is the height of the barometer and h_s is the height of some reference point.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.223
So we really need a reference point in order to use a barometer,

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:21.674
and usually, the reference point is near the surface.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.070
So h_s is the height of that reference point and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.334
T_s and P_s of a temperature and pressure at that height.

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.010
P_b is the pressure measured by

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.120
the barometer and all the other values are simply constants.
