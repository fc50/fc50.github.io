00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Trilateration relies on four distance measurements to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.300
calculate the value of four unknown variables: the GPS receivers,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
3D position, as well as its clock error.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.425
When we measure the time of flight from a satellite to

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.700
a GPS receiver and then convert this to a distance,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.989
we call the measurement a "pseudorange" measurement.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.500
And the pseudo reflects that we have these clock errors.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.429
Let's talk about what's called the Pseudorange Model.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.179
The travel time for a GPS radio signal is

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.784
just the time of reception minus the time of transmission.

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:46.069
You can multiply that by the speed of light to get a distance Ps.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.435
So T in this equation is the receiver clock time at reception,

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:55.920
Ts is the satellite clock time at transmission,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.635
and c is the speed of light.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:02.609
But the problem is that we have these clock errors,

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.980
so I'm actually going to write big T as lowercase t plus tau,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.070
and big Ts as lowercase ts plus tau s. The

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:19.594
lowercase t's are the true receive and transmit times and the taus are the clock errors.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:24.439
So, we can plug these equations into the pseudorange equation.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.179
And we can do a little math.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.995
And we see that the pseudorange is now the true range row

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:37.495
plus this other term which is the difference in clock errors times the speed of light.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:40.850
So, this delta tau is something that we have

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.539
to estimate as well as the 3D position of the vehicle.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.910
And this row is the true range of the vehicle which we could write like this.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.560
And these terms represent the x, y,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.829
and z positions of the satellite at the time of transmission, and these are known.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.829
These terms are the x, y,

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.609
and z position of the receiver and they are unknown.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.824
So, we have one equation here and it has four unknowns,

00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:14.054
but we can generalize to multiple satellites like this.

00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:21.425
And here, I'm using a notation where p1 is the pseudorange to the first satellite,

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:26.344
x y and z are for the unknown receiver location,

00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:29.710
and tau is the receiver's clock error.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.575
And we are assuming that the taus for each of the satellite clock errors is known.

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:40.134
So, now we have a system of four equations with four unknowns,

00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:43.449
and this is a non-linear least squares problem that you could

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.679
solve using the techniques you have learned in the previous lesson
