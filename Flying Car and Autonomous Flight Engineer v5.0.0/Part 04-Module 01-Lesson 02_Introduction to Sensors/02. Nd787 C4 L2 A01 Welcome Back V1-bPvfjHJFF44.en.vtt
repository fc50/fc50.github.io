00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Welcome back, and welcome back Angela.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.724
Thanks it's great to be here.

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:08.129
As you can tell this course is going to be jointly taught by Nick,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.095
Angela and in the next lesson,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:11.880
you'll need a third instructor Stephanie.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.850
So, what are we going to learn in this lesson Angela?

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.509
This lesson is all about sensors and how a flying vehicle

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.695
uses imperfect but complimentary sensors like accelerometers,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:27.045
rate gyros and GPS to accurately estimate where it is in the rock.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.010
Right. Because up until now,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.950
it's been pretty easy to forget about sensors when you're working in

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
a simulated environment where you just assume perfect knowledge of your vehicle.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.859
That's right, but then you start working on real flying vehicles,

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.320
you are going to find that sensors are impossible to ignore.
