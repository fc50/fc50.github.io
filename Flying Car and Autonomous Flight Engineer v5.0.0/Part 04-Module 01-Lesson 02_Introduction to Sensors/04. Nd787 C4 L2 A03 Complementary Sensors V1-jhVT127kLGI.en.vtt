00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Why is it important to have multiple sources of measurement?

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.450
Because none of them is perfect.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.605
Compare the accelerometer to the GPS, for instance.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:15.750
Each of these sensors can be used to get information about the position of the vehicle.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.410
The GPS makes position measurements directly,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.234
and the accelerometer can be integrated to get position.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:24.890
So the question is,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.335
why do we need both?

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:31.664
One important reason is because different sensors are accurate in different ways.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.869
The accelerometer, for example,

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.979
gives us a really smooth idea of where are,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.164
and that's because accelerometers are

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:43.204
constantly running at a really high rate with no drop outs.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:47.174
So we can integrate those measurements to track our position.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:49.799
The GPS isn't as smooth.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.678
The measurements come at a much lower rate,

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.094
and they are susceptible to sudden jumps,

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:59.384
which can happen if we lose track of one of the satellites, for example.

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:04.780
We like that the accelerometer is smooth and low noise in the short term.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.390
But it's susceptible to drift errors which grow with time.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.519
So, if we had these measurements here,

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:15.750
the true trajectory might have actually looked something like this.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.125
The GPS, on the other hand,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:22.605
provides an external positional reference which doesn't drift.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.679
So, even so these points are noisy,

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.269
they are at least generally centered on the true path of the vehicle,

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:36.739
which means we can use GPS measurements to help correct drift from the accelerometer.

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:40.799
So, you can see just from this high level view that GPS and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.909
accelerometers can complement each other when measuring position,

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.144
and this is just one way that sensors can complement each other.

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:54.429
Later, you'll see how we can also balance the trade-offs of

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.060
accelerometers against gyros to get an accurate estimate of altitude.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.990
The three main goals of this lesson are: one,

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.879
combine sensor measurements from different sensors

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.930
on board a flying vehicle to estimate the vehicle state.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.770
You'll do this by using your knowledge of what these sensors

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.925
measure and their accuracy to derive measurement models for estimation,

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:21.160
and that's the second goal.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.585
The measurement models that you derive will wind up

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:28.335
being crucial to the overall estimation of vehicle state.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.784
Finally, you will learn how to use sensor calibration and

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:37.444
initialization to improve the quality of the measurements your sensors make.

00:02:37.444 --> 00:02:40.169
In the next lesson, you will learn how to use

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.530
the measurement models that you derive here along with

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.304
a model of the vehicle in motion to maintain

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:50.164
a robust and responsive estimate of the vehicle state.

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:52.120
For the rest of this lesson,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.175
you're going to go sensor by sensor to learn how each one works and what it measures.

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:03.390
Then we'll discuss how we can model the noise associated with each sensors,

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.489
because no sensor is perfect,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.060
and then we'll discuss how we can reduce this noise by

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860
designing the right initialization and calibration routines for each sensor.
