00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.905
So, you've seen how to do dead-reckoning in some simple examples.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:10.074
But how do we do the full 3D attitude update given gyro measurements?

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:12.609
If you remember from the control scores,

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.019
you can actually calculate the time derivative of

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.009
the Euler angles if we know the body rates and the current attitude.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.010
And since the body rates are what the gyroscopes measure directly,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.005
this is a reasonable approach.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.594
The key equation looks like this.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:35.140
Here, you can see that the derivative of the Euler angles is given by

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.189
some matrix that depends on the vehicle's current attitude times the body rates p, q,

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:45.879
and r. Then if we want to get the Euler angles at time T,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.700
it's just the Euler angles from time T minus one plus the derivative times delta

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.820
T. This numerical integration technique is called the Euler forward method,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.945
and it's the simplest numerical integration that you can do.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:07.359
There are other similar approaches out there as well but this one works very well.
