00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
So, a barometer lets you measure your height with respect to some reference height,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.734
and there are a few ways to get this reference.

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.414
For example, there are reference stations at

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:14.804
every airport which report this pressure and temperature,

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.554
and airplanes can navigate on that,

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:20.304
but however you get this reference,

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.984
the important thing to know is that we can only measure

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:28.655
altitude change by measuring pressure difference.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.200
So, what are the sources of error for a barometer?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.890
First, we have the resolution of the barometer.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.070
Barometers can generally measure with about a 10 Pascal resolution,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.909
and that corresponds to about one meter of altitude difference near the sea level,

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.229
and three meters if you are 10 kilometers above sea level.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.569
Next, barometers are slow sensors.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.520
It takes some time for the air to get in and deform the plates,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.760
so they tend to lag during fast climbs.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.019
There are also interesting sources of noise that we have to deal with.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.459
Turbulence, wind, and propeller downwash are all concerns,

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:15.079
but by far the biggest source of error comes from differences between

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.795
the true and modeled atmospheric temperature and pressure at the reference location.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:23.730
Both of which can vary over time,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.340
so calibrating a barometer basically involves estimating these parameters Ts and Ps,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.810
and to do the estimation,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.150
we have a couple of options.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.105
Ideally, we have access to some reference station which

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:42.079
gives us regular updates about the surface pressure and temperature,

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.140
which they can use to avoid large drifts.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.849
Another option is to do online estimation of Ts and

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.879
Ps if we have an additional drift-free height sensor like GPS.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.159
And when we do online estimation,

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.004
we typically model Ts and Ps as random walks.

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:04.265
Something interesting about this is that in an ideal world,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:08.509
a plane can actually use its barometer and GPS to

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.479
estimate the temperature and air pressure at the airport where it took off.
