00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Even though accelerometers don't measure the true acceleration of a vehicle,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.609
they are still incredibly useful.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:14.160
I'd like to talk about two measurements that we can make with an accelerometer.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.410
And for now, I'm going to assume that we are working for the perfect noise free

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.539
accelerometer that's attached directly to the center of mass of a vehicle.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.574
So, what are the two measurements we can make?

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:33.405
First, we can use an accelerometer to measure the vehicles attitude.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.570
Now we, can only do that correctly if

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.509
we assume there's no net force acting on the vehicle,

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.750
which means the vehicle isn't accelerating.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.049
And remember, this is what an accelerometer measures.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.445
If we assume that the net force is zero,

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:55.755
then that means that the accelerometer is actually measuring G directly.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:01:00.870
So, A sub accel is going to be given by this equation,

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.734
but the measurements that we receive in the body frame are going to look like this,

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:10.920
and this equation just says that the measured components of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.560
the accelerations equal to a rotation matrix times the gravity vector.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.890
When we use ZYX all angles,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.519
we can express the measured components of acceleration as

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.959
a function of the roll angle phi and the pitch theta.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.515
If you solve these equations for theta and phi,

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.135
you get the following;

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:39.120
phi is just the inverse tangent of the measured Y over the measured set,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.290
and theta is the inverse sign of the measured Y over G. Note that we can't measure

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.540
yaw is an accelerometer because

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.850
the gravity vector doesn't change when we change the yaw of the vehicle.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.549
So, that gives you some idea of how we can measure attitude with an accelerometer.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.349
The second thing we can measure with an accelerometer is acceleration*.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.729
Now there's a big asterisk here,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.899
because we can only measure the vehicle's acceleration when the body attitude is known.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.463
And the reason is because we know the attitude,

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:20.324
we know the rotation matrix.

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.514
And when we know the rotation matrix,

00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:26.369
we can write the acceleration of the vehicle like this.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.075
And this equation gives the acceleration of the vehicle

00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:33.329
in the body frame as the sum of the acceleration from

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.600
gravity plus the specific acceleration

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.099
from everything else as measured by the accelerometer.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.030
And as you'd expect,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.289
this acceleration can be integrated to get velocity in the body frame

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:51.584
and that velocity can again be integrated to get position in the body frame.

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:55.310
And whenever we want it to convert back to the old frame,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.159
we just have to multiply by the rotation matrix again.
