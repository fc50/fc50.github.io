00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
I'd like to start by discussing the inertial sensors on board a drone.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:08.524
These include the gyroscopes and the accelerometers.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:11.009
Unlike a sensor, like GPS,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.439
which relies on measurements of the outside world to function,

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.719
inertial sensors really measure motion by taking advantage of

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.979
the physical laws of nature like F equals ma, for example.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.310
So, this drone has inertial measurement unit or IMU in short.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:35.000
And the IMU on the drone has three accelerometers and three gyros.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.019
Each accelerometer measure specific acceleration along

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.005
one axis and each gyro measures rotation rates around one axis.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:49.020
For flying vehicles, the IMU is usually fixed tightly

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770
to the vehicle body and positioned at the center of the vehicle,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.050
so it provides measurements directly in the body frame.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.314
And this is one example of an IMU.

00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:03.644
It's really tiny and also inexpensive.

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:09.375
This one is only a millimeter tall and then a few millimeters on each side.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.750
But inside of this IMU,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.444
there's actually a lot going on.

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:17.744
Here, we have a block diagram of an IMU,

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.859
and as you can see, here,

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.284
we have the three accelerometers and here are the three gyros.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.939
There's also a temperature sensor which is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.929
used to correct the measurements of the other sensors.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.240
Data from these sensors all get fused in the IMU processor.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.414
This processor takes in calibration parameters

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:42.705
and of course the raw data from the sensors themselves.

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:45.010
And then, it has to output some data,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.000
which is our measurement.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.424
Note, that some IMUs also contain a magnetometer and barometer integrated in,

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:55.634
but we are handling those separately,

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:58.694
since they aren't strictly inertial sensors.

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:03.439
For now, let's dive into how these rate Gyros actually work.
