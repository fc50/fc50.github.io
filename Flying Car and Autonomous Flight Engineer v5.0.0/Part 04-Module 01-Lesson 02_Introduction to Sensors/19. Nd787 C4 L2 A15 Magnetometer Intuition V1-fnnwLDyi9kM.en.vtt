00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
The next sensor I want to discuss is the compass or magnetometer.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.910
The magnetometer is able to make measurements of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.080
the vehicle's yaw when we know the vehicle's pitch and roll.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.990
And this measurement of yaw is very noisy,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.640
but it's free of drift,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.199
which means we can fuse it with integrated gyro measurements much

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.869
like how we fused accelerometer data with gyro data to measure roll and pitch.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.050
So the first question we need to answer is,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.890
how does a magnetometer actually measure yaw?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.765
The most high-level explanation goes something like this.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:44.850
One, the Earth has a magnetic field that always points north.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.170
Two, a magnetometer measures magnetic fields.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.649
Three, if we know roll and pitch,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.899
we can measure yaw by using the previous two facts along with a bit of math.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.984
Facts one and two,

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:03.600
we're going to take for granted for our purposes.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.150
If you're interested in learning more about

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
magnetic fields or the physics underlying magnetometers,

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.304
we'll include links to some additional content below this video.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.430
To understand the math of step three,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.310
you can think of looking at it from above.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.090
So this is a bot pointing forward from this point of view,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.674
and the Earth's magnetic field vector points like this.

00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:31.228
And this vector is a three dimensional vector,

00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:36.030
so it might be pointing towards the ground or away from the ground as well,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.070
but we actually don't care about that.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.459
What's important is that and in the x-y plane at least,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.204
we know that the vector is pointing north.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.549
So we can compare the vehicles forward direction to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.840
magnetic north and we see that they differ by the amount psi,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.135
which is equal to the yaw angle.

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.840
Now, the magnetometer that the vehicle has on board,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.939
it's going to measure the x, y,

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.340
z components of the magnetic field vector in the vehicle's body frame,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.870
so it will measure some x-component and some y-component and also some set component.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.825
But since roll and pitch are zero in this case,

00:02:15.824 --> 00:02:18.229
we don't have to care about that.

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.959
Now, you can see that the tangent of this yaw angle psi is

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.629
just the negative y component of the magnetic field divided by the x component.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.995
So the yaw angle can be measured by just taking the arctan of these components.

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:41.545
This math was pretty straight forward only because we assumed roll and pitch were zero,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:45.469
which let us ignore the set component of the measured field.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.074
In the general case,

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:48.849
the math gets more complicated,

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.074
but conceptually, nothing really changes.

00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:54.769
As long as you know roll and pitch,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.080
you can use a magnetometer to measure yaw.
