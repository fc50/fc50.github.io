00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
The magnetometer can be a tricky sensor to work with.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.759
There are a few reasons why this is the case,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.509
but by far the biggest challenge you'll have is magnetometers

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.995
will come from local distortions of the Earth magnetic field.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.594
The reason this is such a problem is pretty intuitive.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:20.699
If this quadrotor is flying along

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.140
and then it measures a magnetic field that points this way,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.370
it's going to assume that this direction is north.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.550
But this assumption isn't always correct,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.734
and there are two main explanations for these distortions to the Earth magnetic field.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.780
The first is magnetic material which may be

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.035
mounted on the quadrotor, near the magnetometer.

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:46.169
In this case, the additional material will add

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.990
some constant bias to every magnetic field measurement.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.969
So, this can actually be handled pretty easily through calibration.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.384
The second cause of these distortions is magnetic material in the environment.

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:03.619
Other vehicles, buildings, bridges, power lines,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.840
these can all have a significant effect as well,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.765
and can't be addressed through calibration.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:13.140
That means you have to treat them as noise.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.250
This makes magnetometer measurements really imprecise.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.805
So how can we compensate for the systematic effects

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:24.305
that are constant with respect to the body frame?

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:29.340
For that, we can look at our standard sensor model with a bias,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.620
a scaling matrix, and noise.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.520
The standard calibration routine is pretty interesting.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.920
Basically, we keep the sensor in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.254
one location so we know that the magnetic field stays the same,

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:44.459
and then we turn it around a lot.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:50.625
So, imagine the tip of this pen points in the direction of the Earth magnetic field.

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.275
Then what we do is we turn the vehicle in

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:59.820
all these different orientations and measure the magnetic field at each one.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.984
Now from your perspective,

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:05.689
you see the quadrotor rotating when I do this.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.609
But in the quadrotor frame,

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.979
the vehicle is stationary and it's the magnetic field vector that's rotating.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.485
You can imagine the tip of this measured magnetic field vector should trace out

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:25.400
a perfect sphere if the magnetometer is working

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.235
correctly and if we cover enough orientations during calibration.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.365
But instead of getting a sphere,

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:35.210
it turns out that what we actually measure is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.530
some 3D ellipse which may not be centered at the origin.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.689
It's a little easier to visualize this in two dimensions.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.030
In 2D, we expect the magnetic fields to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.689
trace out a circle instead of a sphere as we rotate.

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.379
We are going to normalize everything.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.400
The magnitude of the magnetic field is not important here.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.335
So, we expect this magnetic field circle to have a radius of one,

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:05.840
and it should be centered at the origin.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.705
Now, let's imagine actually doing this calibration routine.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:14.840
The magnetic field we measure may look something like this,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.245
and this measured magnetic field clearly has bias since it isn't centered on the origin.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:29.300
It also has some non-zero scaling matrix since it's too small and a bit stretched.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.335
But that's fine, because that's the whole point of calibration.

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.439
After performing this routine and then doing

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.889
least scales to get the bias and the scaling matrix,

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.309
we would be able to transform our real measurements,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.159
so that they match what we expected.
