00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
We've talked about several sensors in this lesson,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.629
and the sensors we've discussed are likely to show up on just about any flying vehicle.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.795
They are all relatively small, low-cost,

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.605
and ultimately really useful for state estimation.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.500
When we use these sensors together,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.925
we can get really accurate estimates of our vehicle state.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.039
For example, we can fuse

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.335
the fast but drift-prone measurements that we get from an accelerometer,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.774
with the slower but drift-free measurements we get from

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:39.920
GPS to make really accurate estimates about the vehicle's position.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.310
But I don't want you to leave this lesson thinking

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.914
the sensor problem is solved, it is not.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:52.670
For example, flying car companies are currently struggling with questions like,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.125
how can we safely and consistently land an autonomous vehicle?

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:02.060
Or how can we do what's called the see and avoid flight?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.269
And this is something that has to be solved before we can

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:10.984
substantially increase the density of flying vehicles in the air.

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:14.310
It's not at all clear what the solution to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.375
these problems will be or even what sensors will be involved,

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:23.609
but likely, they will require sensors that we haven't even discussed in this lesson,

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.334
like stereo cameras, lidar, and radar.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:30.534
So, when you start working in this field,

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.959
be prepared to analyze the pros and cons of

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.000
the latest sensors as you choose which is the best for your particular vehicle design.
