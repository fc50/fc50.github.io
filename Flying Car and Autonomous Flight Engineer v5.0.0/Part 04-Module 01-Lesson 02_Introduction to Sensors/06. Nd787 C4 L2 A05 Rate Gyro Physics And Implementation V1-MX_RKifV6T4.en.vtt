00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
A gyroscope measures the angular rotation about

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.445
a particular axis by measuring something called the Coriolis Force.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.089
The Coriolis Force is something that shows up when

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.974
you try to do physics in a rotating frame of reference.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:19.669
We are not going to get into the math behind this force,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.845
but we can try to understand it intuitively.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:25.739
Imagine you are looking from above at

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.494
a big spinning disk that's rotating with some angular velocity Omega.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:34.130
You can think of it like a merry-go-round.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.585
Now, what would happen if someone's standing in the middle of this disc

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.825
tried to throw a ball at the triangular target shown here?

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:46.780
Well, the ball doesn't care that the disk is rotating.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.649
So of course it would move in

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.320
a straight line and by the time it got to the edge of the disk,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
the target would have rotated far away from where it originally was.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.024
This picture of the motion is from the world frame,

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:02.809
which is an inertial frame.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.230
In this frame, there is no Coriolis Force.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.314
But what happens when we transition into a rotating frame?

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:12.829
Imagine that you were standing on

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.864
the triangular target and someone threw the ball towards you.

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:18.545
From your point of view,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.085
the ball wouldn't move in a straight line.

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:25.625
Instead, you'd see the ball take the strange curved paths.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.370
In this rotating frame of reference,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.005
you would think the ball were being pushed sideways by some force,

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.869
and that force is the Coriolis Force.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.240
So, we can call it FC.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.769
In fact, you could even measure the effect of the force.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.950
Luckily for us, the size of this force is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.365
a function of the rotational speed of the rotating frame.

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:52.819
So, if we are careful about the math,

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.359
we can use a measurement of FC to infer the rotation rate,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.319
Omega of the rotating reference frame.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.779
The Coriolis Force is a force that we can actually measure,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.549
and it shows up only when the thing doing

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.939
the measurement is in a rotating reference frame.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:17.259
This is the basic physical justification for how a gyroscope could possibly work,

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:22.284
but it doesn't tell us how we actually measure the Coriolis Force.

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.039
It turns out there are

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:28.824
several gyroscope implementations that have been used on flying vehicles.

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:33.969
Some of these rely on mechanically spinning some large view of ball

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.634
and then measuring the changes to its motions as the vehicle itself rotates.

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:44.409
But these large mechanical systems unpractical for smaller vehicles.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.905
The gyros you're likely work with are called Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:53.835
These gyroscopes are small MEMS sensors,

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:56.995
and they are by far the most common gyro.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:01.795
MEMS stands for Microelectromechanical Systems.

00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:07.389
They work by having two tiny masses called Proof Masses,

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.574
which vibrate in opposite directions.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:16.204
When there is no rotation these masses just move along a horizontal line.

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:20.050
Now, we can imagine a rotation Omega,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.594
and you should think of this rotation axis as going into the screen.

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:26.895
And if we pause the motion here,

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:31.935
we can see that the mass on the right has some velocity to the right.

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:39.395
This rotation vector points into the screen so that those two vectors are orthogonal.

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:44.125
This is going to lead to a Coriolis Force which points upwards.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:51.395
Note that this force is orthogonal to both the velocity and the rotation axis.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.120
For the mass on the left,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.420
the force is going to point down at this moment.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.674
If you follow this logic,

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:00.314
as the mass vibrates,

00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:06.254
the resulting motion of the proof masses is no longer going to be exactly horizontal,

00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:10.109
but will instead have a vertical component as well.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.200
By measuring this deflection in the vertical direction for both proof masses,

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.800
you can actually infer the rotational rate Omega of the sensor.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.285
Now that we know how gyroscopes measure rotational rates,

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:28.110
we need to know how accurate these measurements are.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.560
To know that, it will help to develop what's called a measurement model for gyroscope.
