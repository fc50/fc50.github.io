00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Let's talk about GPS.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.610
If you ask me, GPS is one of

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.660
the most impressive technologies that humans have ever developed.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.300
Think about it. Right now,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.330
there is a system of satellites orbiting

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.245
20,000 kilometers above the surface of the earth.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.560
On board of each of these satellites is a clock,

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.559
and each of these satellites constantly

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.384
broadcasts its clock time to the surface of the earth.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:33.164
The system of satellites broadcasting clock times is

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:37.484
actually able to localize anyone at any position on

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:41.265
Earth to within a few meters of accuracy if

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:45.780
they have a GPS receiver and an unobstructed view of the sky.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.950
That's pretty amazing.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.925
At this point in the lesson,

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.030
I want to explain how GPS works and how we can take

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.054
advantage of this incredible technology to localize flying vehicles.

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:00.765
So, how does it work?

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.780
Well, GPS actually gives us

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.239
a direct and drift-free measurement of both position and velocity.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:14.155
So let's start by discussing how we get position from GPS.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:21.105
GPS uses something called trilateration to measure the position of a GPS receiver.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.900
Trilateration requires a direct line of sight from

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.665
a GPS receiver to at least four satellites,

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:32.460
and it relies on the fact that we can measure the time of

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.404
flight from the transmitting satellite to the receiver.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:42.010
To understand trilateration, it's easiest to think in two-dimensions first.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.285
Imagine you have no idea where you are but you

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:48.899
do know the position of this single satellite.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.480
If you know the time it takes a signal to get from the satellite to you,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.909
then you can use the speed of flight to convert this time into a distance.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.519
And this distance defines the radius of a circle around this satellite.

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:08.354
So with this one time of flight measurement,

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:12.689
you now know that your position must be somewhere on this circle.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.550
Now, if we add a second satellite and measure the time of flight,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
we'll get a second circle that intersects with the first circle at two points.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.719
So now, you know that you must be either here or here.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.109
A third satellite with a third measurement would give you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.350
one more circle and then you would know with certainty exactly where you are.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.185
In three dimensions, this changes slightly.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:47.215
The first satellite would define a sphere of possible receiver locations.

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:51.405
The second satellite would add another sphere which,

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.650
taken together with the first one,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.659
would give you a circle.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.454
And then, the third satellite would give you

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:04.570
another sphere which intersected that circle in two points.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.750
And actually, these two points are enough to locate you unambiguously,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.370
because one of these points will be somewhere

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.890
near the surface of the Earth and the other will

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.349
be deep in space out past the orbital radius of the GPS satellites.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.039
You might be tempted to think that this means we only

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.864
need three satellites to localize a receiver with GPS,

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:29.905
but we still need four.

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:34.960
The fourth satellite is used to correct for something called the clock error.
