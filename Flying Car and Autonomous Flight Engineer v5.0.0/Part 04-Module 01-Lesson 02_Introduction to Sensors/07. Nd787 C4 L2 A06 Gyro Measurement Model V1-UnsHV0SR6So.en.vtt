00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
The number that you read from a gyroscope is

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:07.390
unlikely to be the correct value of the rotation rate.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.609
In order to make sense of their imperfect measurements that we receive

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.269
from a sensor we first need a measurement model for that sensor.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.899
Once we have the measurement model we can use the measurements we'll receive to estimate

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:27.564
the body rate of the vehicle and then we can integrate to get the actual altitude.

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:32.700
A simple measurement model for a gyroscope looks like this.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.950
Here we see that the measured value of the rotation rate omega is equal to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
the true angular velocity which gets corrupted

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
by some kind of bias that we may need to identify ahead of time.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.449
Plus some additive zero mean Gaussian noise.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.250
So, here the noise is something that changes for every measurement we get.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.219
The bias might be temperature dependent,

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.109
and might change slowly,

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.900
but it's something that stays constant at least for some amount of time.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.800
Now, I'd like to use this measurement to track my angle theta,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.144
and also my uncertainty from time step to time step.

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:19.199
And we can use this army got tilda measurement to update an angle from

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.010
time t minus 1 to t and the equation we use looks like this.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.109
And it's important to note that this is

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.200
a discrete approximation for computing the integral.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
So, really there would also be some epsilon approximation error.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.864
But we're going to ignore that for now.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:42.545
We are also going to assume that any potential bias is

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:45.950
calibrated and removed from the Gyro measurements.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.240
So, our make up tilda just looks like this.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.609
And clearly, for this equation to be useful at time step t,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.510
I would have needed to start with some initial angle theta not,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.900
and then repeated this update with all my measurements up until now.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.380
This type of navigation-by-integration is called dead reckoning.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.379
Inertial navigation that is navigation based on

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.514
inertial sensors only is purely based on dead reckoning.

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:16.679
And as you might have guessed,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.159
it's highly susceptible to drift.
