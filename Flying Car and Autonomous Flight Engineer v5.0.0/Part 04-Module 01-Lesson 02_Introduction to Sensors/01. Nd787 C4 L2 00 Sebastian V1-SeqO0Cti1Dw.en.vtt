00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Let me talk about your eyes,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.564
computer graphics, and computer vision.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:07.830
Every robot, every human being,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.339
every animal perceives its world through what's called sensors.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.199
Your eyes are sensors. Your eyes

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.089
don't tell you whether your grandmother's in front of you.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.675
Instead, it gives you maybe a set of receptive values or pixels of the surrounding scene.

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:24.285
And then your brain somehow is able to map into the state that you care about like,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:25.710
am I facing my grandmother?

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.990
Same with robots. Robots have cameras.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.099
They have magnetometers.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.345
They have accelerometers.

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.785
These are all sensors.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.240
And the estimation problem robots face is to understand,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.594
what is a state given these measurements?

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:40.500
We're going to do this using Bayes' rule,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.350
which you are familiar with, and here's the interesting insight.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.755
In Bayes' rule, you care about P of X given Z.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.780
Z is your measurement, your image,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.000
and X is the state you care about like,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.590
is my grandmother in front of me?

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.440
But Bayes' rule turns this around in the opposite.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:59.519
Bayes' rule says, let's compute a P of Z given X.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.130
Let's hypothesize, I'm facing my grandmother,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.330
and then ask the question,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.650
how likely is this image that I'm seeing right now under this hypothesis?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.880
So in some sense, you solve the computer vision problem going from the image to

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:16.545
the state by implementing a computer graphics problem which is,

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.754
given the state, what is the likely image?

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:21.569
And the nice thing about this is,

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.434
the computer graphics problem is a physics problem.

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:26.810
It's a descriptive problem where sensors work.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.100
So, all we have to do is we have to just model and

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.159
describe how sensors work in a forward way from

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.739
state to measurement and then we can use

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.119
Bayes' rule invert this for editing and come back to the state.
