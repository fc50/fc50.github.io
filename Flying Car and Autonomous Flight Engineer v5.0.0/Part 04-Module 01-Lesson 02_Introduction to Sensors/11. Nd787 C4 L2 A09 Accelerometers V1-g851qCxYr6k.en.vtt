00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
We talked a lot about rate gyros.

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:08.265
Now, let's talk about accelerometers and answer some very basic questions like,

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.650
how does an accelerometer work?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.530
What does it measure?

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.369
You might be tempted to say that accelerometers measure acceleration,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.575
but actually, they don't.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:22.464
Think back to Newton's second law.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:26.795
This law says that acceleration of a vehicle is equal to

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:32.010
one over the mass times the sum of all the forces acting on it.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.784
Unfortunately, accelerometers don't measure

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.494
total acceleration, but specific acceleration,

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:43.304
and specific acceleration is the acceleration that's caused

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:47.759
by all the forces acting on the vehicle except for gravity.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.379
To understand why that is the case,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.120
we can look at a diagram for a simple accelerometer,

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:58.814
and this accelerometer consists of a proof mass that's attached

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:04.004
inside of some housing and constrained so that it can only move vertically.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.140
Now, this proof mass is a attached between the top

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.260
and bottom of the housing with two springs.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.094
And what the accelerometer is going to measure

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.719
is the difference between the upwards force

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.390
provided by the upper spring and the downwards force provided by the lower spring.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.140
So when the accelerometer is sitting on the table,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.269
we know the proof mass has zero acceleration.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:33.509
To achieve this, the NET force from the springs on the accelerometer is going

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.730
to be upwards and equal to the m times g rate of the proof mass.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.420
And because the springs have to provide a NET force upwards that's equal to m times g,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.945
this accelerometer would measure a NET acceleration

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:52.384
upwards that's equal to g. On the other hand,

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:54.520
if the sensor were in free fall,

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:57.045
the housing and the proof mass would accelerate

00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:00.695
downwards at 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:03.869
To keep the proof mass centered in the housing,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.400
the two springs would be pulling equally so the NET force from the springs

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.534
would be zero and the accelerometer would measure zero acceleration.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.810
So, this picture just shows one accelerometer.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.254
A full three-axis accelerometer would need three of these in orthogonal directions,

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:27.824
and the output of a perfect three-axis accelerometer is

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:33.030
actually a measured a_accel that looks like this,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.759
where this term is the total 3D force minus the force from gravity.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:43.439
The accelerometers that we put on real drones are MEMS sensors,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.000
but the physics underlying them is the same,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.490
and this picture is still a helpful one to keep in mind when you try to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.939
remember why accelerometers don't actually measure acceleration.
