00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
In addition to giving us direct measurements of position,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.115
GPS also gives us direct measurements of velocity.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:12.780
I want to emphasize that these measurements really are direct.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:18.484
They don't come from differentiation of two subsequent position measurements.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:22.500
Instead, the velocity measurements we get from GPS

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.509
come from the Doppler shift of the received carrier frequencies.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.860
I'm not going to talk about the Doppler effect here,

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.825
but I do want to mention just how accurate these measurements are.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.440
In the horizontal x, y plane,

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:43.424
the velocity measurements have an accuracy of about 2-5 centimeters per second.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:49.799
In the vertical direction the accuracies are within about 4-10 centimeters per second.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.439
That's really pretty accurate.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.729
It's really useful as a complement to accelerometers.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.899
The position measurements that we get from GPS are accurate to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.414
within about 5-10 meters which is also pretty amazing.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.270
But where do these errors come from?

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.609
One source is atmospheric effects in the ionosphere,

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.379
where free electrons interfere with the transmitted signal

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.674
and corrupt the measurement by changing the signal travel time.

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:23.189
Then there's clock error.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.599
If a satellite's clock is off by one nanosecond,

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:34.049
that translates into an error in position of about one foot or 30 centimeters.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.334
There's also what's called multipath errors.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.500
So, you can imagine if you're standing here,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.299
then there might be some straight line path to a GPS satellite.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.834
But there's other routes that the signal could take.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:52.489
It might bounce off of a tall building and then into your receiver,

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.489
or it might bounce off the ground.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.809
In either case, the measured distance would increase

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.060
substantially and this could lead to sudden jumps in your measure position.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.609
You can correct for this by comparing

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.930
your GPS measurements to your estimate and looking for outliers.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.330
If a new GPS measurement is outside of the three sigma bounds of your estimate,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.210
then it's really unlikely to be correct.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.620
There's one last thing to mention;

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.254
the process of GPS initialization.

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:30.009
Something you may have noticed when using GPS on your smart phone is that

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:35.334
sometimes it can take a while for your phone to get a GPS location fix.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.120
This is also an issue for drones.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.259
When you turn on your drone,

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.745
you usually want to use it right away,

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:46.520
but sometimes we have to wait for the GPS fix.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.409
The reason we have to wait is because it takes some time for

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.180
a GPS receiver to actually find the signals from the satellites.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
That's because the GPS signal strength is pretty weak,

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:05.319
and it takes some clever algorithms and a bit of time to actually identify the signals.
