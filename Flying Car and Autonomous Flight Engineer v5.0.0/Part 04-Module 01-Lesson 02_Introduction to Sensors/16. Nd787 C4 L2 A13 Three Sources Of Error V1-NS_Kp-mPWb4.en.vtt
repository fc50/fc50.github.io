00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
A typical sensor model looks like this,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.125
and this says that the measured value of a sensor

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.099
comes from some bias plus this term here,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.989
which is the identity matrix plus the scaling and cross-coupling matrix,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.600
M. And that's multiplied by

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.975
the true value X and then there's always this additive component of random noise.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.840
So these three terms, b, M,

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.814
and eta are the three primary sources of error.

00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.469
First, there's the bias,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.729
and you've seen that bias is just an offset in a measurement value.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.549
And usually, we model bias as a random walk where the bias at

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.724
time t is equal to the bias at t minus one plus random noise.

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:55.370
And here, you can see some typical biases plotted over time.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.039
And as you can see,

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.710
there's no real upwards or downwards pattern to these biases,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.500
but they do generally tend to move away from zero.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.584
Then, there's the scaling and cross-coupling matrix.

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.449
And if this is zero,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.674
then we only have bias and noise.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.500
But if it is non-zero,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.540
then the diagonal terms indicate that there's a slope error.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.700
So instead of measuring one,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.070
I measure 1.1, and instead of measuring two, I measure 2.2.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.984
The off-diagonal terms indicates some coupling.

00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:32.950
So if this were a three-axis accelerometer,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.909
this could indicate that the X accelerometer is actually influencing the Y accelerometer,

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.149
for example, or it might indicate that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.955
there some misalignment between the sensor and the vehicle body coordinate frames.

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.969
Finally, there's also random noise,

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.353
and the key word here is random,

00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:58.004
which means there's no correlation between past and future values.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:03.879
And usually, this is assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian with some covariance sigma.
