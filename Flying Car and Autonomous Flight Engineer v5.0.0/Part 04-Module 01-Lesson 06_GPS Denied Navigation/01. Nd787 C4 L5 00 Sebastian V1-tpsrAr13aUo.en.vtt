00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
So, we're getting to the end of the course.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:04.339
We want to share some content with you.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.120
It is not required for the final project,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.370
but it's important when you build actual physical systems.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.989
It has to do with the fact that so far we have a very strong reliance on GPS.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.210
Or else it will just not work without GPS,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.714
because if you don't know where you are,

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:21.149
you could start drifting at a certain speed and never figure that out.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.719
The only way to prevent a flyaway scenario is using GPS.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.099
Sometimes, GPS is not available.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.230
This might be because you are next to tall buildings or

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.450
it might be because someone has a GPS Gema,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.050
that's actually exist and GPS is not able.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.714
So, now we're going to give you some information on how to make

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:42.660
a drone fly without GPS and we're going to replace

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.439
GPS using a downward facing camera as a way to track your position on the ground.
