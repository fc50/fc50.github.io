00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Over the last few lessons,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.014
you've seen how crucial state estimation is for autonomous flight.

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:09.974
To perform good state estimation we need a few things.

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:12.809
First, we need a good understanding of

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.810
our vehicles dynamics which we capture an emotion model for the vehicle.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:22.784
Next, we need good sensors and a measurement model that allows us to

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.530
probabilistically update our state estimate

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.910
when we get new information from those sensors.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.960
Finally, we need an algorithm that can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.335
effectively stitch all of these components together.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.299
In the projects you've completed up until now,

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.759
we've taken the vehicle state for granted, for example,

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.239
when you implemented a controller you were given the exact state of the vehicle.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.890
In the final project for this module you'll implement an estimator to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.240
estimate the state of a quadrotor which moves in three-dimensions. Good luck!
