00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
In this final lesson,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.719
we're going to look at a couple of different challenges in estimation.

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:09.625
The first challenge is, how can we incorporate camera images into our estimator?

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.884
We could easily spend multiple lessons on how to use

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.079
images to estimate our position and velocity,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.119
how to estimate the position of obstacles around

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.660
us and how to track other things moving around us.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.454
We're not going to have time to look at all of those questions.

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.019
But a lot of vehicles,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.089
including ones you might already own like the Crazyflie use a very simple approach with

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.949
a downward facing camera to estimate

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.575
the velocity vector using a technique called optical flow.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:38.730
We'll show you how you can use optical flow to get

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.839
a reasonable state estimate for your vehicle even when you don't have GPS.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.930
It's not perfect, but it's a useful thing to know about and

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.920
something you could try for indoor flight on your own quadrotor.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.410
The second thing we're going to look at,

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.189
is an alternative technique to Kalman Filter called The Particle Filter.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.945
The Particle Filter does a much better job of handling range sensors,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:03.765
being used to estimate the position of the vehicle in a map.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.420
Remember that the Kalman filter has

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.719
strong assumptions of Gaussian noise and linear models.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.579
The EKF and UK let us relax the linearity assumption somewhat,

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.799
but The Particle Filter lets us handle non-linear and non-gaussian systems even better.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.424
Notice that both of these topics are designed to give you an estimate without

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:29.844
GPS and GPS to night navigation is really important for flying cars.

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.769
When your vehicle is operating in an urban environment close to the ground,

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.920
our vehicle is in a regime where GPS is very unreliable.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.680
Being able to use additional sensors to compensate for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
GPS errors or manage temporary GPS outages,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.730
is crucial to the reliable operation of your vehicle.
