00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
Let's dive into Optical Flow.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.140
The goal here is to use a downward facing camera to

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:07.974
obtain an estimate of the vehicles x and y velocity.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.240
We're going to do this by looking at what's called the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.789
optical flow of the scene from frame to frame.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.404
At the highest level,

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:17.879
this velocity estimation happens in two steps.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.015
First, optical flow analysis.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.980
We need to analyze the data for my camera to obtain

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.050
the optical flow vector which describes the x and y velocity of pixels in the scene.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.009
Note that these velocities are measured in something like pixels per frame.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.219
The second step is converting the velocity in pixels per

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.984
frame to a vehicle velocity measured in meters per second.

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:42.994
As you can imagine, this step involves a lot of geometry.

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:45.030
The vehicles altitude above the ground,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.495
it's role and it's pitch,

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:50.534
and it's body rates all affect the pixel velocities that the camera sees.

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:53.449
But once you've done this geometry correctly,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.280
you'll be left with a good estimate of the vehicles x and y velocity.
