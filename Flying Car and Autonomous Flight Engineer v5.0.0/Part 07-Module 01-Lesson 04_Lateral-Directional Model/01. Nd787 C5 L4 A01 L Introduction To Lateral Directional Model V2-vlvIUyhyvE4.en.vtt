00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.285
Welcome back. Up until now,

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:05.099
we've been focused on the longitudinal motion of the vehicle,

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.639
where we look at the aircraft from a profile view.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.580
From this view, it was easy for us to define the angle of attack as

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.349
the difference between the direction the vehicles

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.144
moving and the direction that the body frame is pointing.

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:20.134
In this lesson, we're going to focus on the lateral motion of the vehicle.

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:25.380
To do that, we're going to look at the vehicle from above and from behind.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.519
Once again, we'll find that sometimes the vehicles direction of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.570
travel is not the same as the direction the body frame is pointing.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.045
We're going to call this angle the sideslip angle and label it beta.

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.620
As you'll see in this lesson,

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.279
this sideslip angle is going to play

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.024
an important role in the lateral directional motion of this vehicle.

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:47.734
The overall plan for this lesson is similar to the previous lesson.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:52.179
First, we're going to write down the non-linear lateral-directional equations of motion.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.439
Then, we're going to really look at these equations

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.835
with a focus on what's called the side force.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:01.320
We generally want both the side force and the sideslip angle to be equal to zero,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.625
but that can sometimes be tricky when we want to turn a fixed wing vehicle for example.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.129
To solve that problem,

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.890
we'll talk about something called the coordinated turn,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.709
as a technique for properly managing the forces so that turns

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.024
can be executed safely and comfortably for the passengers.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.410
Once we understand the forces on the vehicle,

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.379
will develop a linearize model.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.734
We'll analyze the eigenvalues of this model stability matrix

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:27.560
and identify the three well-known lateral-directional modes.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.250
By the end of this lesson,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.239
you'll have an intuitive understanding for the cause of these three modes and you'll

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.364
be able to use linear algebra to predict the behavior of fixed wing vehicles.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:41.560
For now, let's jump into the equations of motion in the lateral direction.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.019
We'll start by writing the equations for the force free case,

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.439
and then afterwards we can add the forces back in.
