00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.535
When we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the lateral stability matrix,

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:08.585
we get four eigenvalues which correspond to three dynamic modes.

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:10.520
The first eigenvalue is real,

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.384
negative, and generally large.

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:15.205
This corresponds to what's called the roll mode.

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.344
The next eigenvalue is real,

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:21.239
generally small, and can be either negative or positive.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.945
This corresponds to the spiral mode.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.969
The last two eigenvalues are complex conjugate pair.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.250
They correspond to a damped oscillatory motion called dutch roll.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.395
Let's look at the roll mode first.

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.415
This is the simplest lateral mode.

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:39.960
It just describes the damping of roll rate towards zero.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.554
If you imagine looking at a plane from behind,

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:44.079
as it rolls right,

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.729
the right wing hasn't increased effective angle of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.625
attack since it's driving down into the airflow.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.340
The left-wing has exactly the opposite.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.130
Since lift increases with angle of attack,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.594
this means the right wing will actually experienced more lift than the left-wing,

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:03.734
and this will cause a moment which tends to damp the roll rate towards zero.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:08.120
Note that the effect of the roll mode is to damp the roll rate to zero,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.550
doesn't damp the actual roll angle to zero.
