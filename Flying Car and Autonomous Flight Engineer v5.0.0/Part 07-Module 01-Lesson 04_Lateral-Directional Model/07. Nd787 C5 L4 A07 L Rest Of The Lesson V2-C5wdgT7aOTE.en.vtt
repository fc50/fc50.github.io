00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
The rest of this lesson is going to look pretty familiar.

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:04.740
We're going to start by developing

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.875
a linearized model of the lateral dynamics around a trim state.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.919
This is going to allow us to express the dynamics in terms

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.949
of the stability matrix and a control effect matrix.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.250
To analyze the dynamic stability of the system,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.320
we're going to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stability matrix.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.675
When we do this, we're going to find three lateral modes.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:25.699
These modes are well known in aviation,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.175
and are called the roll mode,

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.600
the spiral mode and Dutch roll.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.520
Once we've identified these modes,

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.229
we're going to discuss them and try to get

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.875
some physical insight into the underlying dynamics of each mode.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:38.765
To avoid boring you with math,

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.500
we're going to present the linearized model in text.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.670
You're welcome to try to derive it yourself,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.560
but you should also feel free to take it as it's given.
