00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
The eigenvalue of the roll mode is generally large.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.370
Which means that it's well damped.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.074
This is largely due to how big the wings are.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.489
The other real eigenvalue mode is called a spiral mode.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.000
This mode is associated with an eigenvalue that can be positive or negative,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.649
but it's generally pretty small,

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:21.034
which means it's slow to either damp or diverge.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:23.070
To understand this mode,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.855
we're going to look at two pictures of the same aircraft at the same time.

00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:30.855
We're going to imagine this vehicle is disturbed from straight and level flight,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.390
by a small roll angle phi.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.710
This results in a small lateral side slip velocity

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.770
v. You can actually think of the vehicle is sliding downhill.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.080
Note that there is a downwards component to this lateral velocity in the body frame,

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.820
since the vehicle is rolled.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.850
As the vehicle moves sideways,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.760
the vertical tail gets pushed to the left by the incoming air,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:55.019
which induces a positive yaw rate.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.490
As you saw, when you learned about roll yaw coupling,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.050
this positive your rate will cause the left wing to experience more lift than the right,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.034
which will cause the roll angle to increase even further.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:07.899
If this mode is unstable,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.650
and this behavior isn't corrected,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.215
the aircraft would eventually fly a slowly diverging path in roll, yaw,

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:18.870
and altitude, and eventually the vehicle would spiral into the ground.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.555
Fortunately, the spiral mode can be dealt with by airplane design.

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.450
Wing Dihedral can produce a restoring torque,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.240
and a Small Vertical tail can also help reduce the impact of this mode.
