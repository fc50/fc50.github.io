00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.459
The final lateral dynamic mode is called the Dutch Roll mode.

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.949
This mode corresponds to the only pair of complex eigenvalues from the stability matrix.

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.744
To understand this mode,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:15.779
we're once again going to consider the same vehicle from two angles simultaneously.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.949
I'm going to use curved arrows to denote the roll and yaw rates at each point in time.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.829
We're going to start at T equals zero with this vehicle at some roll angle,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.000
phi, and zero, your angle.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.824
Then we're going to introduce some yaw rate as a disturbance.

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:35.375
As you saw earlier, this yaw rate will cause a rolling moment on the aircraft.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.905
A few moments later,

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.965
the vehicle will look like this.

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.205
Now it has zero roll angle,

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.649
but due to inertia, it still has some non-zero roll rate in this direction.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.074
At this point, the vehicle has reached it's maximum angle,

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:50.730
so the yaw rate has gone to zero.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.909
A few moments later,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.709
the roll rate from before will have rolled the vehicle to some new maximal roll angle,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.390
and the lower right wing will lead to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.615
a yawing moment which will have restored the vehicle to zero yaw.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.859
Finally, inertia will yaw the vehicle to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.980
an orientation like this as the vehicle rolls through wings level.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.835
If we were to plot the roll angle versus time,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.184
we can see that it should start high,

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:21.945
go through zero, reach some minimal value and then return.

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:27.079
We could also plot the yaw angle versus time and we get a plot like this.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.659
These plots look very similar,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.890
except we can see that there is about a quarter cycle or 90 degrees of lag between them.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.540
Now, why is this called Dutch Roll?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.640
The pioneering aeronautical engineer,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.230
Hans Hacker from MIT,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.290
coined the term comparing it to a type of skating called the Dutch Roll where

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.360
skaters skate on the outside of their blades swinging from side to side as they go.
