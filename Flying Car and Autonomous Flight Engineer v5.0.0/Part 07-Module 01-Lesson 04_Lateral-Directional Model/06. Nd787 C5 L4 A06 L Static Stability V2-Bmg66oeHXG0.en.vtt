00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
At this point, you've seen some of the unexpected consequences of fixed-wing dynamics.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.900
For example, you've seen how an aircraft needs to

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.660
roll to perform a comfortable, coordinated turn.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.565
You've also seen how appear yawing motion will actually induce roll in an aircraft.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.009
Neither of these are problems for the vehicle,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.445
but there are real physical phenomena and the autopilot has to be aware of them.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:23.910
At this point, we're ready to start talking about

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.670
the lateral stability of fixed-wing aircraft.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.010
One way to understand stability is by taking the eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.034
This helps us understand what's called the dynamic stability of the aircraft.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:39.799
We're going to do that shortly but we can also get some intuition by

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.194
looking directly at the forces and asking questions about those forces.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.395
One question we might ask is,

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:49.850
when this vehicle is flying in a trim state and gets disturbed,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.609
do the forces tend to restore

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.304
equilibrium or do they increase the size of the disturbance?

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:57.560
Let's start with roll stability.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.455
We use the capital letters L, M,

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:03.619
and N for the moments about the vehicles body x,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.340
y, and z axes.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.500
So, L is the rolling moment.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.659
This letter L is a bit overloaded since we also use it for the lift force,

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.319
but it should be clear in context which is being referred to.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.274
The equation for the rolling moment has two terms.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.800
One is proportional to the ailerons deflection as you'd expect.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.049
The other is proportional to the side slip angle beta.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.340
In general, we want to flight trajectories with zero side slip.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.150
That means that the CL beta parameter is really important.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.609
We call this parameter the Role Static Stability Derivative.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.484
When it's negative, the vehicle will be statically stable in roll.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:43.650
That means that when the vehicle rolls to any non-zero side slip angle,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.185
this term will create a moment that tends to roll the vehicle back to zero side slip.

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:50.780
Next, we can talk about yaw stability.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.165
The yawing moment also has two terms.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.865
One proportional to rudder deflection and one proportional to side slip.

00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:59.030
This moment tends to restore the vehicle to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.120
zero side slip when this coefficient is positive.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.010
This coefficient is sometimes called

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.585
the Weathercock Stability Derivative because if an aircraft is statically stable in yaw,

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.379
it will naturally want to point into the wind like a weather vane.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.509
When designing fixed-wing aircraft,

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.424
a lot of thought goes into the values of these coefficients.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:21.930
This yaw coefficient is heavily influenced by the design of the tail of the aircraft.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.260
The larger the tail and the further off

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.599
the tail is of the center of mass of the aircraft,

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.239
the larger this coefficient will be.
