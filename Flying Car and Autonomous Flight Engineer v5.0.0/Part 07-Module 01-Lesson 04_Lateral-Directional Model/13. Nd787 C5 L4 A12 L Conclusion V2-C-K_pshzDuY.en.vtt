00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
We started this lesson with a full non-linear equations of

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.359
motion for the lateral-directional dynamics of fixed-wing flight,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.484
and we use these equations to understand some important concepts related to flight.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.139
For example, you learned about side slip

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.975
and its impact on the side force of vehicle experiences.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.839
You also learned how to steer a fixed-wing vehicle

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.039
without introducing excessive uncomfortable side force,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.079
by performing a coordinated turn.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.250
You learned about the static stability,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.710
including role stability and yaw stability of a fixed-wing aircraft.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.964
But, as we saw in the last lesson,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:36.255
there's only so much we can learn by studying the non-linear equations of motion.

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.085
In the last half of this lesson,

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.865
we linearize the equations of motion around trim.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.620
We studied the eigenvalues of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:47.289
the resulting stability matrix and identified three lateral dynamic modes,

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.734
the Roll mode, the Spiral mode, and the Dutch roll mode.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:56.115
By now, you should have a good sense for just how unintuitive fixed-wing dynamics can be.

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:58.640
For example, you might not have guessed that

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.649
a yawing motion would induce a rolling moment but that actually does happen.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.329
Now that we have some understanding about some of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.200
the unintuitive dynamics that govern fixed-wing flight,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.219
we're almost ready to start using that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.039
understanding to actually control a fixed-wing vehicle.
