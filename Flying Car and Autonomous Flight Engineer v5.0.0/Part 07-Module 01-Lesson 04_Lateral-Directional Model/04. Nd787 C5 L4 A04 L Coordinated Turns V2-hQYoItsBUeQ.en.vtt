00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Something we haven't really discussed is how to turn a fixed-wing aircraft.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.804
Consider an aircraft flying at constant speed in a circular trajectory.

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:11.570
Even though the magnitude of this aircraft's velocity vector isn't changing,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.505
the direction is constantly changing,

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:16.920
and changing direction of the velocity is an acceleration.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.950
This acceleration is always directed towards the center of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.054
the circle so we call it centripetal acceleration.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.890
For any object to move in a circle at constant speed,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.370
there needs to be a centripetal force that provides this acceleration,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.539
and the size of that force must be equal to MV squared over R,

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.195
where M is the mass of the object,

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:37.630
V is the speed, and R is the radius of the circle.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.295
So, if you want an airplane to fly a circular trajectory like this,

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:43.005
we'd need a force directed inwards,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.150
and the size of that force has to be equal to MV squared

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.729
over R. One option would be to generate a side force,

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.949
but we just talked about how lateral accelerations

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.545
are perceived as uncomfortable by passengers.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:58.005
So what we really need is something called a coordinated turn.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.280
A coordinated turn works by rolling the vehicle,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.125
and using a component of the vehicles lift vector as the centripetal force for the turn.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.480
Consider an aircraft viewed from behind.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.800
From this angle, we can see the lift and weight vectors which point up and down.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.239
The idea behind a coordinated turn is to roll the vehicle so that a component of

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:21.574
the lift force actually points towards the center of the circle we want to follow.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:25.280
Here, we see the aircraft rolled to some angle phi.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.710
Now, the lift vector has a vertical component given by L cosine phi,

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.704
and a horizontal component given by L sine phi.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:35.700
This horizontal component is the centripetal force,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.570
so it must be equal to M times V squared over R.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.979
The vertical component bounces the weight so it must be equal to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.115
M times G. If we divide these two equations,

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:47.199
we're left with this,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.180
the tangent of phi is equal to V squared over R times G. Or,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.790
we can take the inverse tangent of both sides.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.710
We can use this equation to determine what roll angle

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.659
we need in order to follow a circle of a certain radius,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.439
while moving at a certain speed.
