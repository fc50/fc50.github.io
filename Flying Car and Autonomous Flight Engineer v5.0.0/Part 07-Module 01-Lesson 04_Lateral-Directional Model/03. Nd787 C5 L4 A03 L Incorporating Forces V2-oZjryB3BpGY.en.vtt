00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
These 11 equations, are the equations of motion

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.459
for a vehicle with no forces acting on it.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.210
Below this video, you'll find the full versions of these equations with forces added in.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm not going to go over each of these equations individually,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.585
but there is one equation that's worth discussing and that's the equation for v dot.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:24.094
Remember, u, v, and w gives the velocity of the vehicle in the body frame,

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:26.404
along the x, y, and z axes.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:32.500
So, v dot is the lateral acceleration of the vehicle in the left or right direction.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.429
This lateral acceleration is caused by all the lateral forces on the vehicle.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.394
Collectively refer to these forces as side force.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.960
In general, we want side force to be as small as possible,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.649
since lateral acceleration is generally an uncomfortable sensation for people.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.399
But before we can minimize side force,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.634
we need to understand where it comes from.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:55.564
With forces added back in,

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:59.044
the full equation for v dot looks like this.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.810
This first term comes from the component of the vehicle's weight,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.155
that points are laterally,

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:07.150
when the vehicles rolled at some angle phi.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.165
This next term is the dynamic pressure times the surface area of the wing,

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:13.785
multiplied by everything in these brackets here.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:17.489
As you can see, the terms in these brackets depend on,

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:18.914
the size of angle beta,

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.350
the roll rate and r rate of the vehicle,

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:23.844
and the ailerons deflection delta a,

00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:27.289
and the rudder deflection delta r. I encourage you to take

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.800
a few minutes to look at the lateral equations of motion, before moving on.
