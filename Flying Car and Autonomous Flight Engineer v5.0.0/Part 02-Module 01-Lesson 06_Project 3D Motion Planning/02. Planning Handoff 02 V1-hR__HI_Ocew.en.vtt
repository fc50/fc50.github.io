00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Congratulations you've finished the lessons on motion planning,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:04.799
and with the tools you've developed,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.154
you're ready to complete your next project.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.870
In this project, you'll again be flying in a simulator,

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.894
but this time in a more complicated 3D environment.

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.794
So Andy, how is this going to work?

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:16.769
Well Nick, basically, we're going to take

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.829
the methods and the algorithms that you've laid out in these lessons,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.654
and going to combine them to build an amazing 3D motion planner.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.341
So, Nick's laid out a lot of material in the past several lessons.

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:29.580
And now, it's up to you to design and build

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.769
a motion planner for your quadcopter. But don't worry.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.140
I'm going to show you how to build up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.109
that baseline implementation that you need for this project.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.000
And then, if you're feeling inspired,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.890
you can take it to the next level with some of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.054
the more advanced techniques that Nick presented.

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:44.395
How does that sound to you Nick?

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:46.650
That sounds pretty good to me Andy.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.219
I can't wait to see what you build.
