00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
In the previous lesson, we saw how to take a set of obstacles,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.240
and render them into a discrete grid with each cell

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.880
marked as feasible or infeasible based on the location of obstacles.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.110
And that labelled grid then became your state space for the planning process.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.090
You've seen that you can use an algorithm like A* to find

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.990
a minimum cost sequence or grid cells that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
represents the path that you want your vehicle to follow.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.650
Turns out however, that representing a plan is a sequence of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
discrete grid cells isn't really the best plan for a vehicle to follow.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.225
Fact, given your autopilot a list of all the grid cells in a path,

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:36.720
it's a bit like someone giving you directions to walk to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
the local supermarket by saying something like, "Open the door,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.100
step out of the house by putting your left foot forward,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.910
and do the same with your right foot,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.360
then again with your left foot,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.145
and again with your right."

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.245
Rather than just saying, "Head down to the corner.

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.155
Make a left, and go up half a block."

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:57.660
In this lesson, the first thing we're going to look at is how to convert your list of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.830
grid cells into a better plan that represents what you actually want the vehicle to do.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.250
After that, we'll look at new ways to discretize

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.410
your world that don't rely on a grid representation.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.675
And you'll see that how you choose to represent obstacles and

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:16.425
freespace really has an impact on your ability to find not just collision free plans,

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:19.000
but optimal plans. Let's get started.
