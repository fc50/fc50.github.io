00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
So, the world is a continuous space.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.870
There's infinitely many places where a drone could be.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.020
And to make this computation interactable what we've done is we've

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.780
chop the world into little kind of blocks called a grid.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.790
And then we believe that inside the grid,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.965
the detail doesn't matter, and the we have finally many of these boxes.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:26.020
Problem with that is for a three dimensional space as big as your city,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.940
you have an awfully many grid blocks to represent.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.445
And that means a lot of storage and lot of computation.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:38.120
Now, people discritize the space in different ways.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.840
Grid is just one is a uniform discritization,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.630
but sometimes it makes sense to discritize in different means.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.860
For example, you might talk about intersections and road segments.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.810
Those are typically thought as a graph.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.960
A graph is a discritize of space with discrete notes that correspond,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.775
for example, to intersections and discrete arcs in between.

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:01.900
And you might say, "That's crazy for the skyward."

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.750
If you fly a viewer plane today in

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.650
the United States or anywhere in the world you'll find that the FAA,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.370
the Federal Aviation Authority or whoever it

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.910
is has already chopped your sky into a graph.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.330
There is Jet ways and Victor Vaisse and via points and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.090
view hours that define an invisible graph in

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.200
our sky and on in which each commercial plane flies.
