00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Using the techniques presented in previous lessons,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:04.965
we saw that in a grid world like this,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:06.735
place an obstacle right here,

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:08.853
you can find a plan that takes the vehicle,

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:13.780
for instance, up and over a sequence of cells and then down.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.940
Now, let's think about what this plan actually means.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.465
If you send this plan,

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:20.824
the sequence of grid cells to the autopilot,

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.105
what you're really asking the vehicle to do

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.530
this to travel through a sequence of short goals.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.550
So, you're telling the autopilot to go from

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.933
the start location up to some intermediate goal and then stop.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:36.560
The vehicle asked to turn and it goes to the next intermediate goal and stops again,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.620
and it goes to the next cell and stops and then over and stop and then over and stop and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.085
then turn again and go down and then finally arrive at the final goal.

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:46.930
What a cumbersome plan.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.830
Now, the reason that the autopilot is going to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.005
stop in each grid cell is because remember,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.105
the autopilot is just the lizard brain of the vehicle.

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:57.470
What's really happening is that the flight computer is sending

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.330
the autopilot the next goal or waypoint one location at a time.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.170
What we really want the vehicle to do in this case is to go up,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.575
then turn and travel a long distance to the next goal,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:11.960
and then turn and then go down.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.845
We don't really want so much a sequence of grid cells for the vehicle to follow.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.685
What we really want is a sequence of waypoints for the vehicle to travel between,

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:21.860
rather than all of these grid cells.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.545
We'd rather tell the vehicle to travel to one, two,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:28.190
three waypoints and the autopilot will have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.050
a lot easier time following this plan of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.310
just a few waypoints than the original series of grid cells.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.000
The question that arises then is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.975
how do I take that sequence of grid cells and turn it into a sequence of waypoints?

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.585
There's more than one way to go about this,

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:44.270
but next we'll look at a simple test you can use to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.285
remove intermediate grid cells that lie along a line

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:49.610
and find a set of waypoints that approximates

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.000
the original plan and still keeps the vehicle safe and collision free.
