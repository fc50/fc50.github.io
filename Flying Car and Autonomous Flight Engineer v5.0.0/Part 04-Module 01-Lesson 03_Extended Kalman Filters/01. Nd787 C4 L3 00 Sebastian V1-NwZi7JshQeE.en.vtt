00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Let's talk about Kalman filters.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.650
Kalman filters were invented by Rudolf Kalman in the 1950s.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.270
Although technically speaking, there were

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.625
two other folks who did this before him, long forgotten.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.230
I think Thielen Starling.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.560
Never mind. Kalman filters allow you to integrate measurements and

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.359
controls in a continuous space to find this continuous state estimate.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.210
We're going to code our first Kalman filter here and for non-linear systems,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.960
as you'll see, we're going to build what's called an extended Kalman filter.
