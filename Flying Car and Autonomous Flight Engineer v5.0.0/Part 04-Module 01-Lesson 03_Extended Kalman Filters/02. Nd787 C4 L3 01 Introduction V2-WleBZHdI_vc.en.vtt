00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Welcome back, I'd like to introduce you to

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.339
your instructor for the next two lessons, Stefanie Tellex.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.960
Thanks, it's great to be here.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.310
And it's great to have you here.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.695
So, should we explain what this lesson is all about?

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:13.290
Yeah, well, so far in this course,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.629
you've learned a lot about making measurements and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.344
incorporating those measurements into your state estimator.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.559
That's right. But up until this point,

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.129
we've had to assume that the vehicle wasn't moving,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.234
and state estimation for a stationary vehicle just isn't that useful.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:27.719
So in this lesson,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.679
you'll learn how we can use something called a Kalman filter, and later,

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.155
an extended Kalman filter to incorporate

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.759
the controls we command the vehicle into our state estimator.
