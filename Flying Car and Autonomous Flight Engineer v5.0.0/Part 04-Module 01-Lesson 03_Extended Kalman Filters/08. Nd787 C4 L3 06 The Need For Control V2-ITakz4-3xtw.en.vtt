00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
So, with this exponential moving average,

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.934
we have to make this trade-off.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:07.589
If we make alpha close to one,

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.125
then we trust our previous estimate much more than any new observation,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.870
and this leads to an estimate that's pretty

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.285
robust against really bad measurements which we like,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:23.219
and that leads to pretty smooth estimates of state,

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.649
which is good if the drone state actually is smooth.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.644
But when the drone starts moving,

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:32.429
this breaks down and the estimate is slow to

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.854
respond to new measurements from the drone's new position.

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:41.309
So, large alpha is robust, but not responsive.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.355
So, we can make alpha small and choose to believe our new measurements.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.889
And with this approach,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.594
we will see that changes in the drone state get quickly incorporated in the estimate,

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:59.069
but the estimate is really susceptible to getting tricked by bad measurements.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.480
So, small alpha is responsive, but not robust.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.609
Now, what I want is to have my cake and eat it, too,

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.578
I want an estimate that's fast and responsive,

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:14.704
but also still robust against bad sensor measurements.

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:17.359
And the way that we can achieve this is by

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.715
using something very general called a Bayes' Filter,

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:27.140
and the basic idea of the Bayes' Filter is that we're going to incorporate control input,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.950
what I told the drone to do,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.605
and sensor input, what I measured about the world.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.780
And we're going to do this in the mathematically correct way

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
according to how we've defined our model of the system.
