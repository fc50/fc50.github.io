00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
In this lesson, you will learn how to maintain

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.419
an accurate and responsive estimate of a vehicle state using

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.490
something called a Kalman Filter for

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.335
linear systems or an extended Kalman Filter for non-linear systems.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.289
Both of these algorithms are implementations of

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.049
a more general algorithm called the Bayes Filter,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
which uses a cycle of motion prediction and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.945
measurement update steps to maintain a belief of a vehicle state.

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:31.140
The thing that made the KF and EKF special was

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
the assumption that our beliefs were described by Gaussian's.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.378
With that assumption in place,

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:42.239
the mathematics of the base filter just turned into sequences of Matrix operations.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.630
The difference between the KF and the EKF had

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.050
to do with the linearity of our motion and sensor models.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.289
So for the one dimensional vertical drone,

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.359
our motion model and our sensor model were both linear functions of their inputs,

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.609
and because of that we could solve

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.524
the estimation problem optimally using a Kalman Filter.

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:09.644
But when we try to use a Kalman Filter on our weird 2D drone we ran into problems.

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:13.769
Both the motion model and the sensor model had non-linear terms in them,

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:17.039
which meant we couldn't write them as matrices.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.245
The extended Kalman Filters solves this problem by calculating the Jacobian

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:27.525
of these models to linearize them around the current estimated state of the vehicle.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:33.060
These linear approximations have to be made at every time stamp and when we do that,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.909
we can treat this system as if it were linear.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.579
In the next lesson,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.474
we'll take the idea of state estimation into three dimensions,

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:44.579
and also learn about another variant of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.319
the Kalman Filter called the unscented Kalman Filter.
