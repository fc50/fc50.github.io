00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.294
As you've seen earlier in this course,

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:04.339
sensors are not perfect.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.925
And we can capture the imperfections in a sensor using something

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.650
called a measurement model which tells us p of z given x.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.199
That is, the probability of making some measurement, for example,

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.589
with the rain sensor,

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.129
given a certain state,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.449
for example, how far the drone really is above the ground.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.905
And often, these measurement models are Gaussian.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.679
The most likely measurement is centered around

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.835
the true value of whatever the sensor measures,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.350
but there's some covariance as well.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.890
In the next exercise,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.170
you'll simulate noisy measurements and see what happens when you try to

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.760
use those noisy measurements directly to control a 1D drone.
