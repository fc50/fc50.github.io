00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
So, the idea behind the Bayes' Filter

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.710
is that we'll know where the drone is from two different sources.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.339
First, we know what commands we send to the drone,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.929
and we'll use that knowledge to predict the new state.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.589
And of course, when we do that,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.929
there's going to be some error in our prediction,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.405
but we can still do something with that information.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.734
And second, we still get to use the sensor measurements,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:27.269
and of course, there's error in our sensor values.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.490
But the fancy math trick will let us put these two pieces of information together in

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.440
the right way to get the robustness benefits of

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.854
averaging but also the responsiveness of fast updating.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:44.774
The Bayes' Filter is a very general idea with many implementations.

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:46.409
So in this lesson,

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.994
we're going to discuss the Bayes' Filter first at a high level,

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:54.209
and then we're going to talk about one implementation called the Kalman Filter,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.439
which is what happens when we represent everything as Gaussians.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.214
And what happens is matrices.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:06.060
Then, we'll dive into the extended Kalman Filter or EKF which is what

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.545
happens when everything is Gaussian but the state or observation models are non-linear.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:16.484
And then, we can linearize around the state to make things Gaussian again,

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:19.349
and basically, use linearization to make things

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:22.799
Gaussian and then everything works out just like a Kalman Filter.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.569
In the next lesson,

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.739
we'll also discuss the Unscented Kalman Filter or UKF.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:33.599
And this is an even fancier math trick which is actually simpler to implement.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:39.239
And with a UKF we estimate a non-linear state using special particles which we

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.909
can pass through a non-linear system instead

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.075
of linearizing the system like we do with the EKF.

00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:46.980
In a later lesson,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.590
Nick is actually going to cover another version of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.359
the Bayes' Filter called the Particle Filter,

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.304
where we use particles or samples to

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:59.240
estimate a non-linear distribution which is not Gaussian.
