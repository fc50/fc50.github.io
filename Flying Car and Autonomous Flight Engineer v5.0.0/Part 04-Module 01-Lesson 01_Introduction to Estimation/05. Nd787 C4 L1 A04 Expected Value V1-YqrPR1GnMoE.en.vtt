00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
One calculation, we can perform with a random variable is called the expected value.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.370
I can define this expected value here,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.625
which you can see is a function of the components of the random variable.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.539
It's the integer value of the random variable,

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.410
times the likelihood of each of those outcomes all summed together.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.039
Now, the expected value of a random variable,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.719
where the underlying events are

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:28.279
truly non-numeric quantities such as working or not working,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.065
they may not be all that useful.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:33.325
Let's say that we had working is zero, not working is one,

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.185
and mostly working is two,

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:39.594
the probabilities are 0.9, 0.05, 0.05.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:42.740
If I compute the expected value of that variable x,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.289
it's going to be equal to 0.15.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.750
What that means is really unclear.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.929
But imagine our sample spaces actually a numeric quantity,

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.990
such as the number of GPS satellites that a flying car can detect.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.435
Our random variable looks like this,

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:00.280
with the number of satellites and probability.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.094
If we compute the expected value over this random variable,

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:09.355
then you have the expected value of x is equal to the sum of p of x of i,

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:13.380
times x of i, which is going to be equal to 0.1 times one,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.560
plus 0.1 times two, and so on.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.700
That's going to be equal to three point 3.5,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.670
and it tells us something about the number of satellites that we might

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:38.650
expect to see at any given time.
