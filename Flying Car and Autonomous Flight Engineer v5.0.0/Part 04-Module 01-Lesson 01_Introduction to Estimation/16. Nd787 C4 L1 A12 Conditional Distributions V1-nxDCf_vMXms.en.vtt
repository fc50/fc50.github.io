00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Another useful property of

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.570
joint random variables is that it's often of extreme interest to find a density of one of

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.919
the unknown random variables given specific knowledge of other random variables.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.929
For instance, is a vehicle moving given the current state of the propulsion system?

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.774
Written this way we have the Joint distribution p of x and y.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.909
But we often want to know what's p of x given y?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.969
And that is a conditional distribution.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.204
A very useful rule and probability is that

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:32.519
p of x given y is equal to the joint divided by the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.910
marginal of the conditioning variable that is p of x

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.764
given y is p of x and y divided by p of y.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.880
This rule is called the chain rule.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.100
A really useful application is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.980
sometimes we want to reverse our conditional probabilities.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.609
Recall our thought experiment of the autonomous UAV receiving GPS measurements.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.089
Let's call the GPS measurements y,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.920
and these measurements are noisy.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.375
We could estimate our position x as a conditional probability using p of x given y.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:07.064
And remember this can be read as the probability of position x,

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:09.254
given GPS measurements y.

00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:11.069
If we've acquired a model of

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.229
the position probability density function

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.960
given a measurement then we have everything we need,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.119
but it's often much easier to obtain

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.770
a model of the measurement distribution given a position,

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:22.454
p of y given x.

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:25.439
We can apply the chain rule twice to derive

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.715
an expression for p of x given y for p of y given x.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.780
This is what is known as Bayes rule.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.260
And Bayes rule in Bayesian estimation is

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.755
a foundational concept in estimations of statistics in general.

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.699
Bayesian techniques have enabled a huge amount of autonomy in a variety of ways.
