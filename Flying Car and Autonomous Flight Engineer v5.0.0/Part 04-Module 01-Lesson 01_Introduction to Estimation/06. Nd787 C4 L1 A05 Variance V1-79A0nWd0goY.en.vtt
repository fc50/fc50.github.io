00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
You can, in fact, compute lots of different functions of random variables,

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.315
but the expected value is one of

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.410
two very useful functions of random variables that we'll see a lot.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.120
The expected value is often referred to as expectation, the mean,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.099
the average, the first moment,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.135
and it is exactly the quantity we had a second ago.

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:22.120
When we drop the i indices,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.640
that quantity is the sum over all the outcomes of x times p of x.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.115
I'm going to use x bar to represent the expected value of this random variable x.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.175
Another useful quantity we'll compute a lot is the variance,

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:40.579
which is the sum of x minus x bar all squared times p of x.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.429
The expected value is,

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.435
on any given draw from the distribution,

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.385
what is the value we expect to get?

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:50.489
Not the most likely, but the average value that we'd expect to

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.734
get if we were to continue drawing from this distribution over and over again.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.089
The variance, sigma squared,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.915
tells us how spread out these samples will be around the mean of x.

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:05.939
People sometimes use the variance as a measure of how well we know the mean,

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.349
something like a confidence.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.479
It's important to understand it isn't that,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.195
but it will tell us how much the samples vary.

00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:15.554
You might also have heard of a quantity called the standard deviation,

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:19.360
where the standard deviation is a square root of the variance.
