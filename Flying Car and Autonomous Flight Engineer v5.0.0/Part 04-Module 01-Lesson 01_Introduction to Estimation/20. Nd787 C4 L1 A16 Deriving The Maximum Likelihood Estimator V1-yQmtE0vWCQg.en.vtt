00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
We have our measurements and we want to know what vehicle state in

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.265
our thought experiment is most consistent with those measurements. How do we do that?

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.720
Mathematically, we're going to select our estimate x-hat to be

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.565
the value of x that maximizes the probability of our actual measurements y-tilde.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.920
There are two steps to this process.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.025
First, we're going to figure out what is the PDF,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.714
the probability density function of p of y given x.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:31.995
Remember, this function tells us the likelihood of the measurement y when the state is x.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:36.469
We're next going to select our estimate x-hat to be the value that yields

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.960
a maximum likelihood of the actual measurements y-tilde given that estimate x-hat.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.035
These two steps, let's look at them in turn.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.244
First, we have to figure out what is the PDF,

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:52.549
the probability density function of p of y given x in this model.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.484
We're going to assume that this distribution is Gaussian.

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:58.339
That means we need an expression for the parameters,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.785
that is, the mean and the covariance.

00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:03.479
Since y equals Hx plus v,

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.015
it's easy to show that the expected value,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.219
the mean, y-bar is equal to H times x.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.569
Given the properties or a noise model it's also easy to show that

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.708
the covariance y minus y-bar times y minus y-bar transpose

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.590
is going to be equal to the covariance of just the noise and that's equal to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.965
R. We now actually know the parameters of this distribution p of y

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.500
given x for any x it's going to be

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.030
a normal distribution with a mean of H times x and covariance

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.189
R. We just need to find a value of x-hat that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.215
maximizes the likelihood of the actual measurements y-tilde given x-hat.

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:44.905
How do we do this? Let's look at the full formula for this Gaussian.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.064
Here, I've just written out the formula of the Gaussian.

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:53.450
Plugging in effect the mean is H times x and the covariance is R. We can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.454
see this consists of a normalizer term here which does not depend on x at all.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:03.575
For the likelihood of the received measurements of y-tilde given x,

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:07.900
the specific choice of x has no impact on this normalizer and we can ignore it.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.849
If we want to maximize this overall function,

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.155
then what we actually care about is maximizing the term that's in the exponent here.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.754
Which means we just need to maximize the function in the exponent.

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:21.939
A standard way to solve for the maximum of a function like

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.569
this is taking the derivative and finding where it is zero.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.905
If we take the derivative of the exponent,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.439
set it equal to zero, and then solve for x,

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.960
we get this term right here;

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.170
x-hat is equal to H transpose times h to

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.649
the power minus one times H transpose again times y-tilde.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.990
And so, this is a solution to

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.885
the least squares estimation problem given some measurements

00:02:43.884 --> 00:02:46.509
y-tilde that are linearly related to

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.814
some unknown quantity x by this matrix H that we assume that we know.

00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:54.759
Using that, we can solve for the most likely estimate, x-hat.
