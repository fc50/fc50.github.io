00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
The uniform distribution that you just saw,

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.415
was parameterized by the parameters A and B.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.669
In general, a probability distribution will typically be

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.365
parameterized by some small number of parameters.

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.449
We will use theta to collectively refer to all of

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.750
the parameters that describe a particular distribution.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
One thing to emphasize is that P of X given theta is not

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.469
the same thing as saying the function that

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.769
describes the density of X is parameterized by theta.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.354
This particular condition here P of X given theta,

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:35.750
implies theta is a random variable itself.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.284
What can be the parameters of a density function?

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:42.509
Well, two common distributions are the Uniform,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.795
and the Gaussian, or the normal.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:48.245
The uniform has a couple different ways to parameterized it.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:50.744
There is the A and B bounds you just saw,

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:53.609
or we could say that we have say a mean,

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.994
and we have a width, and this is mu minus w, mu plus w,

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:01.094
and the height of this distribution is one over two w,

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.960
the mean of this distribution is that mu,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.439
and the standard deviation winds up being w over root three,

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.575
which makes the variance equal to w squared over three.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:14.269
This distribution says all possible outcomes are equally likely,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.799
and sometimes this is the only thing we can do when we have

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.894
no idea what the parametric family p of x actually is.

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:25.379
The other distribution that we'll see most of the time in this module is the Gaussian.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.929
It's the familiar bell shaped curve,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.365
centered at some mu,

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:31.530
with some width given by sigma.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.189
The density function is given by p of x equals one,

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.319
divided by the square root of two pi,

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.539
sigma squared times e to the negative x minus mu all square over two sigma squared.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.960
The Gaussian has a few interesting properties.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.689
First, it's symmetric around the mean mu.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.500
Second, the probability that x is within plus or minus one,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.140
standard deviation of mu is 68 percent,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.944
and the probability that it's within plus or minus three sigma is 99.7 percent.

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:03.779
Notice how sigma describes how wide the distribution is.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.129
When sigma's small, that will make the peak narrow and sharp,

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.240
and this implies that we have a high confidence of

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.260
predicting what a sample drawn from x will be.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.454
When sigma is large the Gaussian,

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.060
the normal distribution is very wide and flat,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.235
and that means we have poor knowledge of what exactly

00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:23.520
any given sample from this distribution is going to look like.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.340
So, you can see that a continuous distribution like a Gaussian,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.150
can actually be fully described by two parameters mu and sigma squared,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.200
and taking together, these parameters are the theta for this distribution,

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.744
that I referenced earlier.

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:43.770
Solving estimation problems often boils down to using data often from sensors,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.200
to come up with estimates for the values of these parameters.
