00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Estimation is something that you and I do every waking moment.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.824
For example, right now, I'm getting sound waves in your ear with my voice,

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.219
and somewhere in your brain,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.480
you form a belief as to what words I just uttered.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.929
Okay, this is called estimation.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.070
Robots have the same estimation problem,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.240
they need to know where they are X, Y,

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.219
and Z and possibly fetch for the pitches for the rotors.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.144
So now, we're going to focus on estimation.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:29.509
Estimation at its core is a temporal process,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.679
so you integrate things over time,

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.679
and it's a process of managing uncertainty.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.979
You can never be 100% certain what I've said or whatever it is.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:44.640
We're going to use Bayes rule as a method to integrate data over time.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.359
Bayes rule is a method to take multiple sources of information,

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.575
and coming up with the distribution that is

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:53.280
the best reflection of what the state might be.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.620
And your goal is going to be to make a very tight distribution,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.839
so as to fights certain ways.
