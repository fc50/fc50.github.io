00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.059
So far, we've discussed discrete events such as the number of visible GPS satellites,

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.074
or the state of the vehicle being working or not working.

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.209
What about continuous samples spaces,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.920
such as the real value position of a satellite?

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.684
Random variables become extremely powerful in this case.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:23.294
Using real numbers to index the members of a continuous set, it's fairly intuitive.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.880
Let's first begin by defining a specific function called

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.674
the cumulative distribution function F sub x of u.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.350
This function F sub x of u with a capital F,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.730
describes the probability that the random variable x is less than or equal

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.179
to u. F will be monotonically increasing.

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.909
The limit as u goes to negative infinity is zero,

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.839
and the limit as u goes to a positive infinity is one.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.000
This is the cumulative distribution function.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.619
It's important to understand that the index to the function is u,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.879
but its sub-scripted by x to indicate which random variable we're characterizing by

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.969
the probability that the value of that random variable is less than u or not.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.260
Now, we can define lowercase f sub x of u,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.320
which is equal to the derivative with respect to u of uppercase F sub x of u.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.954
This is what we call a probability density function.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:22.159
Since we are dealing with a continuous sample space,

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.179
we can no longer say anything about the probability

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.420
that our vehicle is at some specific or exact location,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.609
because for a continuous sample space,

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.834
the probability of any particular value will always be zero.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:38.319
We can only give the probability that our vehicle is in some region.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.094
Consider this uniform probability density function for the position x of a vehicle.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:49.480
As you can see, it has the value one half between x equals zero and two,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.250
and zero everywhere else.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.838
I could calculate the probability that the vehicles in this region between zero and one,

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:57.894
by calculating the area under this curve,

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.075
which would be one times one half.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:05.920
In fact, the probability that a random variable will take a value between x1 and x2,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.705
is just given by the integral of the probability density function from x1 to x2.

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.700
This lowercase f of x isn't the probability,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.939
and it can easily be greater than one.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.419
But we do often write this density function as p of x.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.405
This changes our notion of what it means to be a proper distribution.

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:26.145
To be a proper density,

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:30.439
lowercase f sub x of u has to be greater than or equal to zero,

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.909
and the integral under the distribution has to be equal to one.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.150
Normalization implies finding a constant multiplier in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.920
front of this density function to make it integrate to one.
