00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.379
Welcome back.

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.889
At this point, you've learned how to plan paths for a flying vehicle,

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.984
and how to control a flying vehicle so it can actually fly along those paths.

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.980
That's right, but up until now,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.600
we've made an assumption that we can't

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.865
make when we're working with a real flying vehicle.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:18.329
We've assumed that we always know what the state of the vehicles is.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.789
Exactly. For example, the controller you just

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.599
implemented was somehow able to use the vehicle state variables like X,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.580
Y, and Z, in its control logic.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.264
In reality, we never know the vehicle state with certainty.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:31.960
It's something that has to be estimated.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.660
So, in this lesson and the lessons that follow,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.779
you'll learn how we can estimate the state of a flying vehicle.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.100
And in the project that follows,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.920
you'll implement your own estimator for a quadrotor.
