00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.338
To begin talking about probability,

00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:03.960
let's define some terms.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.515
Let's say that there's a space of possible things that might happen.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:11.205
For now, we're going to describe a discrete set of possible outcomes.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.679
Before we dig into position estimation,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.959
let's start very simply and just think

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.870
about whether the vehicle is working or not working.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.440
Each of these we call an event or outcome,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.940
and together they form our sample space.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.740
We're going to assign to each one of these

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.239
some probability or relative likelihood of that outcome.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.670
Let's say, we have a highly reliable vehicle with 0.9

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.315
probability of it working and 0.1 probability of it not working.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:40.140
These numbers with the outcomes define a probability distribution.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.100
To be a properly normalized probability distribution

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.185
the sum of these probabilities has to equal one.

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.660
We can in fact write this distribution as

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.629
a function that maps from the outcomes to numbers.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.810
All probability function maps to numbers between zero and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.920
one where zero probability means an event is guaranteed to not happen.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
At a probability of one means an event is certain to happen.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.519
When we have discrete outcomes we can call this function a probability mass function.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:11.579
And if we have relative frequencies of things,

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.590
they may not be in the range zero to one,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.185
but we can make the relative frequency sum to one by normalizing,

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.320
taking the sum and dividing.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.839
Once we have a probability mass function

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
we can use it to answer a couple of questions such as,

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.074
what is the probability of some event or

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.269
outcome given that some other event or outcome occurred.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.879
This is called conditional probability.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.584
We can also sample from the space of possible outcomes,

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:40.905
and for some distributions we can ask what is the most likely event?

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:45.000
However, this particular representation where we write

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.079
down the names of the different outcomes is not as helpful as it might be.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.340
If before working out the probabilities we first have a function that maps

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.659
each outcome to a number then we can ask and answer more questions.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.614
So, let's say we have a set of outcomes, say,

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:03.839
working, not working, and let's add mostly working.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.980
We can map them to the integer numbers zero, one, and two.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.254
So, now we have this mapping of outcomes to integers and then the probabilities say,

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:15.180
0.9, 0.05 and 0.05.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.969
This map of integers to relative frequencies or

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.014
probabilities is what's called a random variable.

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:25.049
We're going to use as notation the letter X to represent the random variable

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.120
which in this case, is this entire table of integer numbers.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.990
X of I represents one entry in the table,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.680
P of X represents the column of probabilities in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
this table and then P of X of I would represent one entry in that column.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.689
Now, that we have a random variable that maps events to

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.919
numbers we can perform computations over the events.
