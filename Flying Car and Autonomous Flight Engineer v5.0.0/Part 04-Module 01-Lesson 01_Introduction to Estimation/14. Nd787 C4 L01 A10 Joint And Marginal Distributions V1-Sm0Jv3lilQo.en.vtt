00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
Now, I made reference earlier to the fact that if we have a multivariate distribution,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.440
we can't just assume that we have

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.150
a probability distribution around each variable or field in the vector,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.074
and operate with those separate probability distributions.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.750
The reason for that is that a lot of the time,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.350
knowing the value of one field in your vector tells you something about the other fields.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.109
So for instance, if you have a vehicle that has a distribution over a state x, y, z,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.989
knowing the altitude of the vehicle may tell you

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.725
something about the lateral position of the vehicle or vice versa.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.609
You can't treat those probabilities separately and differently.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.975
What that means is that we often have joint distributions,

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.554
where if our vector value is x,

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:49.244
then p of x is actually equal to the p of x1 and x2.

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:52.394
If x is equal to the vector x1 and x2.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.920
This function p of x is a probability distribution over

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.100
these two variables that takes the vector as an input and outputs a scalar density.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.530
But what if we only want to worry about the probability over x1?

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.570
Can we still use that joint distribution? The answer is yes.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.339
We can compute what's called the marginal simply

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.219
by integrating x2 out of the density function.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.599
If we have many variables in our vector,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.429
we can just integrate out all the variables we don't want to get a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
marginal over any subset of variables we do want.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.820
Now, it might be the case that the system that

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.625
you're estimating has many more than two variables.

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.819
Your flying vehicle may have variables for x, y,

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.314
z, roll, pitch, yaw, that's six.

00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:40.094
You may also have variables for the derivatives which takes it to 12.

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:43.319
You might also have variables that track what's happening in the environment.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.279
So, if you're tracking other vehicles in the air,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.099
then your joint estimator would be all of your 12 degrees of freedom,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.093
plus the 12 variables,

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:55.539
the six degrees of freedom and the derivatives for all the other vehicles,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.950
and that distribution is going to get unwieldy very very quickly.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.275
But only some of the variables may actually have information about each other.

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:10.664
It might be the case that some of the random variables in the vector are independent.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:15.269
Independence is the property that the joint probability density function is

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.355
really the product of individual densities of the component variables.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:24.074
We can see the effect for a 2D Gaussian where,

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:26.294
if I have x1 and x2,

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:28.439
and if x1 and x2 are correlated,

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.740
then I may have a distribution which is kind of tilted up like so,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.100
and you can see that if you have a positive x1,

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.680
then you're very likely to have a positive x2.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.819
If you have a negative x1 you're very likely to have a negative x2.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.359
On the other hand, if I have a spherical Gaussian like this,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.630
then knowing where I am on the x1 axis,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.884
tells me very little about where I might be on the x2 axis.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:55.649
Really, this idea of independence is that knowing the value

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.250
of one variable has no effect on the other random variable,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.748
and knowing the value of x1,

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.400
tells us nothing about x2.
