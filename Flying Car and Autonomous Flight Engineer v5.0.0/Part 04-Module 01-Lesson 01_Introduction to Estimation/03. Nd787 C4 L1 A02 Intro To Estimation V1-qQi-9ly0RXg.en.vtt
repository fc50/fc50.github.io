00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
In this module, we're going to look at the question of estimation.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.560
There are several forms of the estimation question,

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.019
but the most basic is where is the vehicle,

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.424
what's its attitude and how fast is it going?

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.734
Answering these questions is often referred to as navigation or localization,

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:20.050
but there are other questions you could ask such as what is around the vehicle?

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.615
Estimation shows up in techniques called mapping

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:25.434
and slam which you may have seen in other courses.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.625
Another question you might ask is,

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.234
well there are other vehicles in the sky, where are they?

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:34.045
How fast are they going? That is often referred to as tracking.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:37.600
The same mathematical tools that tell us where a vehicle is,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.000
what its altitude is and how fast it's going

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.119
can also be used to answer all of these questions as well.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:48.384
You might say, well we have GPS and we've got sensors so why does this matter?

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:50.509
Why is it the slightest bit interesting?

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.434
And first of all GPS is a great tool for knowing where vehicles are,

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:59.535
but estimation is actually what makes GPS work and GPS itself is not perfect.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:02.699
The other day, I was flying into Boston's Logan Airport and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.995
the in-flight GPS suddenly put the plane

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.600
over the Atlantic and then quickly brought it back again.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.069
That's really unlikely and a good estimator would know that it's probably

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.839
an erroneous GPS measurement and discard it or do something sensible with it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
Estimation underlies a huge number of technologies: flying

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:24.464
vehicles of all kinds from tiny drones to large aircraft rely on estimation.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.219
The Apollo spacecraft for example,

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.609
was a huge success in terms of estimation,

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.579
and estimation also underpins a lot of

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.049
how your phone works in terms of

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.974
knowing how to orient the screen when you turn your phone.

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:40.265
What is at the core of the estimation question is really uncertainty.

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.709
The real world is fundamentally uncertain,

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.244
and it's uncertain in a couple of important ways,

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:48.020
one is that the world is stochastic.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.170
The effect of actions can have uncertain outcomes,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.030
the vehicle could be traveling a path you might

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.310
intend for the vehicle to follow this nominal path,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.409
but it might get hit by a gust of wind and blown to one side or the other,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.454
or the vehicle could be flying on some nominal path and suddenly stopped working.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.400
That change in state is a source of uncertainty,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.490
you never know when it's going to happen.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.040
The second thing is there are things we might be uncertain

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.209
about in terms of the current state of the world: where is the vehicle?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.770
What's behind that building over there?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.840
We can't know where everything is in the world and the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.469
way we describe this is to say that the world is partially observable.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.264
Historically, there are lots of ways to quantify uncertainty.

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:32.074
Probability is generally the most common and the most powerful.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:34.009
People have looked at using other things like

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.069
confidence scores or you may have heard of fuzzy logic,

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.984
but at the end of the day we're going to stick with probability.

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:42.920
That's because there's good sound theorems for example,

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.769
the Dutch Book theorem which says that probability is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.375
the only rational way of representing uncertainty in making decisions.

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:53.344
Either, you are implicitly using the axioms of probability or

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:55.580
you're actually going to make a bad decision in terms

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.920
of estimating what the state of the world is.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.539
We're going to talk about probabilities as the relative frequency of outcomes.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's dig in and remind ourselves of how probability works.
