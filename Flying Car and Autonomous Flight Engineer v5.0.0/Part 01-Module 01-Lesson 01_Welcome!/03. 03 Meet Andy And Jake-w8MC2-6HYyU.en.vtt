00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Hello and welcome to the Flying Car Nanodegree Program.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.185
We'll get you coding up self-flying drones and flying car fleets in no time.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:11.445
But before diving in, we want to say hello and give a quick program overview.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.365
So, to start, hi.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.265
I'm Jake and I'm the product lead for the Flying Car Nanodegree Program.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:22.125
Before joining Udacity, I was a computer science PhD candidate at Stanford University,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.230
where I specialized in AI, robotics, and perception.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.500
As product lead, I make sure everything from classroom content,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.030
to your career prospects,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.039
to the curriculum are top notch.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.359
And speaking of curriculum-

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.884
Hi. I'm Andy and I'm the program curriculum lead.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:38.609
I studied physics at MIT,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.594
and I've been involved at Udacity since basically day one.

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.439
I've worked on everything from psychology,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.179
to physics, to self-driving cars.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.460
And as curriculum lead for this program,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.799
I work directly with our instructors to make sure

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.349
you get the best educational experience possible.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.910
Great.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.905
Now that you've met Sebastian, Andy, and myself,

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:58.079
in the rest of this lesson,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.412
you'll meet our other amazing instructors,

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:01.979
learn about how the program works,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.644
and wrap up with a little fun.

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:07.750
We're thrilled to be working with you and welcome to the program.
