00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.605
We have a vision for the future.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:07.975
In that flying cars,

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.730
and flight is going to be a part of

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.060
the transportation network to an even greater degree than it is already,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.510
and there are technical challenges,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.535
and there's a need for people trained in specific foundational concepts,

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:23.290
and future-looking, forward-facing concepts that people still need to know now,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.565
in order to develop that technology.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:28.060
The flying car nanodegree is Udacity's sense of what

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.765
the concepts are the people need to know in order to make flying cars a reality.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.080
A lot of the development will be in the context

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.770
of a smaller scale drone because of what people have right now,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.780
the issues are same really at every level at every size of a vehicle.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.290
This program is unique because it includes

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.435
the fundamentals about the vehicle dynamics both multirotor and fixed-wing,

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:54.511
but then carries this through to real practical implementation.

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:59.090
So you will implement your own controller as the major and mission planner.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.340
The students are going to develop a variety of skills.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.480
We're going to begin very simply with just giving students

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.330
a project that shows how you command a simple drone.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.810
How does a vehicle know where it is?

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.275
How does it execute a flight plan,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.335
and how does it decide what that flight plan should be?

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:16.060
And so, the very first skill is just like,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.585
what are the mechanics of actually getting an air vehicle under control?

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:20.980
Even if it's only in simulation,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.140
everybody will have gone through the experience of connecting

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.945
to a UAV or a drone of some kind,

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:28.000
and putting it through its paces.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.350
We're sort of setting it up as just like a little flight in your backyard.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.540
In fact, we're calling the project, the backyard flight.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620
The second project the students will be looking at is 3D motion planning.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.070
How do you generate a plan that is ideally suited for

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.438
staying as far away from buildings and other obstacles as possible?

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:44.159
And also, how do you set up the planning problem so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
the vehicle for replanned as quickly as possible, if necessary.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.480
So we really want students to be thinking about

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.260
all these different tradeoffs as they build towards that first project.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.680
So in the controls project,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.270
students will learn to implement a flight controller from scratch,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.445
that will stabilize the vehicle,

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.090
and allow the vehicle to follow a path.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.780
Then we'll start to drill down a little bit more

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.050
into how the vehicle is actually executing those flight plans.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.335
How does the vehicle know where it is?

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.725
How does the vehicle take in sensor data,

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:13.285
GPS, and other kinds of data,

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:16.150
and then construct a consistent estimate of where it is,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.710
and what its attitude is in space?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.355
For robots to understand the world, it needs sensors,

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:29.035
and state estimation is the field that describes how different sensor information,

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:33.528
and sources of information can be best combined to make sense of the world.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.230
So in the state estimation project,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.150
students will design an algorithm that uses sensor data from GPS

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.445
and IMU to estimate the position and orientation of our flying robot.

00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:48.190
In term two, we're going to dramatically expand the scope

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.590
of technical challenges that the students are going to be thinking about.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.165
We are going to really make sure that the students

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:57.895
understand some of the low-level and foundational concepts.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:01.744
We're going to move away from the very simple drone quadrotor model.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:05.230
Look at the challenges of modeling the dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.600
and a hybrid aircraft that can either go into full aerodynamic flight,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.680
or go into hover, and so on and so forth.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.290
Later on in the course,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.385
we will also study how we can coordinate a whole fleet of

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:23.420
drones to achieve a task together such as delivering packages to customers.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.875
To people who want to get a start in robotics,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.840
or aerial robotics, frankly,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.490
there's no better way than sitting down and starting to just implement simple things.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.045
Having that comfort with just implementing things and trying things,

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:41.585
is a great foundation for coming into the Udacity Course.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:44.435
There's really a tremendous amount of autonomy

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:47.540
and intelligence required to get us from one

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.560
off prototype demonstrations to the kind of reliability

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.050
that is going to allow a scalable, reliable, operable service.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.590
My prediction for the future is that 80 percent of

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.590
all transportation of people and goods can be autonomous in the next 30 years.
