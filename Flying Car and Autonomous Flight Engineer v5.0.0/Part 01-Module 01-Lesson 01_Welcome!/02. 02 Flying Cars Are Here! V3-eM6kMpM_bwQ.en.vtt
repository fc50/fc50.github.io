00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Hello. My name is Sebastian Thrun.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.740
I'm founder of Udacity and I'm one of the instructors in

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.265
our new Nanodegree that we called Flying Cars.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.680
Flying cars is a bit of a misnomer.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.975
This is about drones, about anything flying.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.420
But there's a nascent new industry here in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.845
Silicon Valley and around the world that looks into

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:24.015
flight as a transportation medium for goods and people on a daily basis.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.730
Now, we have the chance here at Udacity in Silicon Valley,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.710
to be at the heart of innovation.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.350
And we see things that others don't quite see yet.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.870
Ten years ago, we saw that self-driving cars would become a big topic, and guess what?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.485
It's become the biggest topic in Silicon Valley today.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:40.530
I predict in five years time,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.865
flying vehicles will be the biggest topic in Silicon Valley innovation.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.605
And the reason I believe is this,

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:49.095
transportation is a huge industry,

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:51.287
really important for people,

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:55.182
but the ground is very limited in transportation.

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:56.750
If we could build vehicles,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.995
it would easy to go off vertically,

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:01.285
fly us to where we want to go, and land.

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:04.065
You could go faster, of course.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:09.245
We could be safer because of fewer things to hit in the sky than on the ground.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:13.505
And we will be environmentally more friendly and use less energy.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:16.850
And the last thing is a bit of a surprise but if you look at the modern aircraft,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.795
when a modern aircraft loses its power,

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.695
it glides down at a glide ratio of about one-to-15 or so,.

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:28.590
which means, the energy consumption used for lift for keeping a flying vehicle in the air

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.611
is only a 15th of the energy used to combat the air, which is what we call drag.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.850
Now, we've built this Nanodegree to be the first in the world to teach flying cars.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.530
There's no other place I can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.620
imagine that would teach that material that we're teaching here.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.285
And once students graduate from this class,

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.360
easily find a job, and can tell you,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.660
former company Kitty Hawk,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.880
they are desperately looking for people to hire.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.175
And we put together a skill set and set of instructors who are world class.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:58.425
This new industry is small today.

00:01:58.425 --> 00:01:59.940
It's going to be big tomorrow.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.900
Amazon, Google, and others will use drone-based systems.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.198
Others will follow. Your pizza will fly in.

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:09.782
It sounds all like science fiction but the chance you get in this Nanodegree

00:02:09.782 --> 00:02:14.980
is to really become part of that science fiction and make the future.
