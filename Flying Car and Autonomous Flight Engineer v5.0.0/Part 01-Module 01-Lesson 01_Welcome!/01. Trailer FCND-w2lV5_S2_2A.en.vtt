00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.054
I am firmly convinced,

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:05.493
that in the future,

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:09.504
the majority of urban transportation will take place in the air.

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:12.845
It's something that, we a society,

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.245
have wanted for over 100 years.

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:18.934
Little kids grow up drawing pictures of flying cars,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.859
building them out of lego, and dream of having their own one day.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.225
We called it flying cars because it's our aspiration,

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.037
we really want to change the world with flight.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.820
It might start with the Amazon and Google

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.699
package delivery but it's going to go to people.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.939
We're already seeing it happen with self driving cars.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.359
We've already seen it happen with little drones.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.185
These different kinds of technologies are enabling new kinds of transportation.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.789
We are going to cover drone technology with variety levels.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.009
We're going to spend some time talking obviously

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.219
about the higher level autonomy and the mission planning.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.899
Really what this course is about,

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.429
is giving students the chance to implement algorithms

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.240
and ideas and technical concepts on aircrafts.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.484
What we want to do is we're going to try and make that future happen sooner by

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:08.233
training future engineers in the technologies needed to make that vision happen.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.669
Udacity is a great starting point for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.855
anybody who wants to learn more about these technologies,

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.570
more about this application domain,

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.183
and more about flying vehicles.

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.295
This is something that no one talks about.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:21.150
But I promise, in a few years time,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.005
it'll be the hottest topic on the planet.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.549
So, come to the skies with us by

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.759
applying this world's first flying car nanodegree program.
