00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.865
It is my really great pleasure to introduce the three instructors in this course.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.985
Angela, from Germany originally but at Toronto now.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:13.890
Angela heads the Dynamic Systems Lab at the Institute for Aerospace Studies at

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.350
the University of Toronto and she's also

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
the Associate Director of the Center for Aerobotics Research and Education.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.650
I had to cheat because the title is longer than

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.860
any other title I've seen in my life. So, what does it mean? What do you do?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.125
So, I'm leading a team conducting research at the interface of robotics,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.805
controls, and machine learning.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.455
And what this means is,

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:39.345
we built robotic systems that can learn from experience and from each other,

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.850
and the goal is that they, through that,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.485
can do tasks better,

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:46.980
operate more safely and are generally more independent.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.475
That's exciting because even if you got 10,000 Amazon drones in the sky,

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:52.680
if this one learn something about the world,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.710
all the 9,999 others will learn the same thing.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.840
That would be one of the ideas.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.300
That's great. Nick, Nick Roy,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.010
we've known each other for a long time because we've

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.750
worked together at Carnegie Mellon University

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.710
but he's now Professor of Aeronautics and Astronauts at MIT,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.110
and he leads a group of researchers in CSAIL,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.360
MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab. What do you do?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.870
Well, to first-order, I'm

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.640
very lucky to have a great group of students and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.415
post-docs and I do PR and fundraising for them.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:24.100
But more specifically, what we do is

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.265
we look at a lot of related issues to what Angela was mentioning.

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:30.940
Issues of vehicles, how they navigate in complicated,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.630
cluttered environments where you don't have external infrastructure like GPS, et cetera.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.240
We look at the issues of how these vehicles understand what's

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.195
happening around them especially in a human-centered environment.

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:43.060
They need to be able to interpret what's happening around them,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.365
understand what people want,

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:46.780
and make safe and reliable decisions.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.900
Now, together, we're building the Nanodegree program on

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.410
flying cars and flying cars is a bit of a misnomer.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.060
It's not going to look like cars with bumpers,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.820
but the field of flying

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.265
vehicles is becoming incredibly hot in Silicon Valley and around the world,

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.890
and I'm super delighted we could attract

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.360
two super stellar professors to teach this business program with us.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.630
So, we came here together because we are building this joint Nanodegree,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.520
it's the world's first educational program on flying cars and hopefully,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.260
in a good Udacity fashion,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.580
we will teach more students

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.860
these technologies and all universities in the world combined.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.270
Let's find out. But I wanted to ask both of you a bit

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.850
about what you're actually teaching and about the interesting problems

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.550
are for students. Maybe start with Nick?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.536
Okay.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:36.705
So for me, the flying car is a great aspirational goal.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:38.205
We've got a long way to go.

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:41.790
The real content that I want students

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.975
to get from this is addressing the challenges of making these vehicles smarter.

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:49.500
So, one of the dirty little secrets of any unmanned system,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.580
whether it's on air, on the ground,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.720
is the total labor,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.135
human labor required to operate that unmanned system.

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:56.385
These vehicles are fundamentally really dumb.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.140
All they do is get from point A to point B.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.320
They can't react to the unexpected and in the ways that people can.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.915
They can't adjust what they're doing.

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:05.310
That kind of intelligence,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.780
that kind of reasoning, that kind of autonomy,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.620
is core to what we're trying to teach for enabling flying cars.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.670
Great.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.110
So, what I'm really excited about in this Nanodegree is that we really teach

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.570
the fundamentals on how the physics of

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.435
these vehicles were both fixed-wing and multi-rotor.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:24.855
But then, take it all the way to a real implementation

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:28.980
either in a high-fidelity simulator or the real drone itself.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.410
And I think, both skills really are needed to bring the field forward in the future.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.185
And I'm so excited that both of you are such great instructors in our Nanodegree program.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.475
And for you who are watching,

00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:43.710
if you're interested in becoming a student, enroll or apply,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.500
and I guess, I'll see you in class.
