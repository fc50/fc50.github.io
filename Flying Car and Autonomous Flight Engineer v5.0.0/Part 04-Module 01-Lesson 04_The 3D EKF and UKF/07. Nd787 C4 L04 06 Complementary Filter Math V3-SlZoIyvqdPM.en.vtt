00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's walk through the math that underlies the complimentary filter.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.699
We assume the state acts that were tracking is the

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.794
vehicles pitch and roll angles: theta and phi.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.820
We also assume that these angles stay close to zero.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.800
The linear complimentary filter that we will implement will

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.240
not perform well when these angles stray far from zero,

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.079
though it's possible to adapt

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.684
a non-linear complimentary filter in a way that allows it to work for any attitude.

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.979
So, the measurements come as a measurement of

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.879
theta and phi from the accelerometer and a measurement of

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.679
theta-dot phi-dot from the gyros and these measurements come

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.570
with some frequency and we can denote the time between sensor measurements as T_S.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.945
So, now we want to come up with an estimate for theta and

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:58.869
phi based on this measurement z sub t and the previous estimate at time t minus one.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.659
To do that for theta we use the following algorithm.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.954
Here, tau is a time constant and T_S is the filter sampling period.

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:13.450
Then this equation says that my new estimate is going to be equal to some coefficient,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:22.260
tau over tau plus T_S and all of that times the old estimate plus theta-dot times T_S.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.640
This multiplication of theta-dot times T_S is just an integration.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.120
So, basically in this first term,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.810
we're taking the old estimate and we're adding the change from the gyros.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.769
And this measurement isn't very noisy,

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.839
but since we're performing an integration,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.005
this estimate is susceptible to drift.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.834
Then we have the second term.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:50.239
And this is just this coefficient T_S over tau plus

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.019
T_S times the direct measurement that we get from the accelerometer.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:02:00.840
And this is a much noisier estimate but it won't be susceptible to drift.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.380
And the idea is that we're going to put a low-pass filter on

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:09.879
the noisy estimate and a high pass filter on the other estimate,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.694
and this allows us to get the benefits of both approaches by using these two filters.

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:20.169
And note that this coefficient and this coefficient together sum to one.

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:25.794
So, we can tweak the behavior of the estimator by adjusting this time constant tau.

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:29.439
But in general this first coefficient will be big,

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:36.159
maybe 0.95 and this other coefficient will be smaller closer to 0.05.
