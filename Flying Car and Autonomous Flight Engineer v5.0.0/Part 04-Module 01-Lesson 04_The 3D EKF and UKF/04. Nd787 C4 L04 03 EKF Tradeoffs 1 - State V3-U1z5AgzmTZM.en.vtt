00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
At this point, I want to emphasize that there's more than one way

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.425
to do an EKF for a quad in three-dimensions.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.394
Every approach has to make some trade-offs.

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.539
Even in the design of this course,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.375
we had a lot of discussion about the best way to do it.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.850
The approach we ultimately chose is one reasonable option,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
but it's not the only option and it's also not necessarily the best option.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.714
The option we chose is the result of trade-offs between

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:34.560
implementation complexity, explainability, and functionality.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.340
The two choices I want to explain are our choice of EKF state vector and input.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.945
Almost everything else is a consequence of these two decisions.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.664
So, first our choice of EKF state vector.

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:54.619
What we're going to do is use something called a complimentary filter for attitude,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:01:01.320
direct gyro measurements for the body rates and an EKF for position, velocity, and yeah.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280
So, our EKF state vector is going to look like this.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280
You could also choose to not put roll and pitch in the complimentary filter,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.329
you could put it as part of the EKF state as well.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.814
Then you could do all your estimation within EKF.

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:20.280
But if you had the full pose in the EKF,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.290
then you would have something like a 15 or 16 dimensional-state vector and then 15 by 15,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.530
or 16 by 16 Jacobians.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.260
People do that, but it's a lot to keep track of and it gets hard to debug.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.365
So, we chose something that's a little simpler for this course.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:42.060
You won't get quite as good an estimate when you put attitude into a separate filter,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.079
but it will still work for typical flight and it's a very common thing to do as well.
