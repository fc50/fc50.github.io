00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that we've got prediction figured out,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.060
we can move on to the measurement update step.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.189
And this is going to require defining a measurement model h,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.884
and then finding the jacobian h prime for each of our sensors.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:18.285
So, let's go through our sensors.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.640
We can start with GPS.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.484
We get position and velocity from the GPS.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:30.289
So, this z_t is the measurement you'd get.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.204
And since we're directly measuring all of these state variables,

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.039
the measurement model is really straightforward,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.754
and this means the jacobian looks like this.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.525
The other sensor is the magnetometer.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:48.619
And this gives us a measurement of the yaw angle psi.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.784
Again the observation model is straightforward.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.914
We just measure psi directly.

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:57.045
And the jacobian looks like this.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:02.090
And these two sensors are all that you'll need to handle in the final project.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.030
And since it turns out that everything is linear for these sensors,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.105
the update step is especially straightforward.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.314
But not all drones have GPS.

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:15.359
Some drones like the crazyfly for example,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.519
use a camera and something called optical flow to measure the velocity of the vehicle.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.179
The math for optical flow involves a lot of geometry,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.960
but Nick is going to teach you more about that in the last lesson.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.079
At this point you should have everything you need to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.760
implement the update step for the 3D EKF.
