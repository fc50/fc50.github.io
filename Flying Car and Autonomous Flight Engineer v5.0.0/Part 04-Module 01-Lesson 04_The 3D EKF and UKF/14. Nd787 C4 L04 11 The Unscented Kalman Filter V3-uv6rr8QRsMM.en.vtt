00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
The Unscented Kalman Filter, or UKF,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:08.804
doesn't try to have a linear approximation for the g or h function.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:13.580
Instead, it approximates the probability distribution itself.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.070
So, if this is our distribution,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.390
a UKF would select a small set of weighted sample points such that the mean and

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.240
covariance of these weighted points is

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.864
equal to the mean and covariance of the distribution.

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:32.234
These special points are called sigma points.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.769
The UKF propagates the small set of

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.055
weighted points through the non-linear g or h function.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:45.284
Then we can calculate the mean and covariance of the transformed sigma points

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:51.140
and just use these empirical values as the mean and covariance of the new state estimate.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.880
But, where do these special sigma points come from?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.140
Naively, we might just say,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.149
more points must be better,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.614
and select as many points as we possibly can.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.480
This brute force approach could work,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.655
but it could be computationally prohibitive pretty quickly.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:15.754
The real magic behind the UKF is what's called the Unscented Transform,

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:21.579
and the first step of the Unscented Transform is getting these special sigma points.
