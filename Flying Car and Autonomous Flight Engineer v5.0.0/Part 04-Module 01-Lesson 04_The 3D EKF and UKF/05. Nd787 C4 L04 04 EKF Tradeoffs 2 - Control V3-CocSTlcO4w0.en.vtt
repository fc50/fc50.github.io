00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Next, I want to discuss our choice of control input.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.299
Our control input is not going to be

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.919
the collective thrust and three moments that you worked with in the controls course.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.949
Instead, we're going to be using the X, Y,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.609
and Z accelerations as well as the R rate psi.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.300
Considering what we chose to use as a state vector,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.214
this makes some sense to use as a control input if we can.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:27.579
But I want you to really look at this for a

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.359
second and think back to the controls course as you do.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.655
Are we allowed to do this?

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:39.320
Can we just say we're going to use the acceleration and the R rate as our control input?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.798
Remember, that the thing we get to control are the rotation rates of the propellers,

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:50.079
and these map directly to one collective thrust and three moments.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.134
Shouldn't those be our control inputs?

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:57.054
The answer is yes we could and usually do

00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:01.344
use the real control commands as the control vector in our estimator,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:04.314
but we certainly don't have to do that.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.780
So, how do we do this?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.665
How do we use the accelerations and psi.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.540
as a control input?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.200
We're actually going to handle this using a weird trick.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.379
These control inputs are actually going to come from the IMU measurements.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.489
The accelerations will come from

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:26.299
the accelerometer on the inertial measurement unit, and psi.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.465
will come from the Rate Gyro.

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, the right thing to do would be to use the IMU for measurements since well,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.015
it's a sensor, but many sources actually use the IMU as a control input.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:44.359
One reason this is the case is that for lower cost terms,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.125
the control commands don't always

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.724
accurately reflect the controls that actually get executed,

00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:55.219
while the measurements made by the IMU actually do reflect reality.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.814
So, because the IMU directly measures these accelerations,

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:02.245
and acceleration is in some sense

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:04.910
what you're controlling when you're moving the drone around,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.245
we can justify using the IMU as our control input.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:11.960
We could of course use the IMU as a measurement,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.469
and use the commanded controls as the control input.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.609
But the tradeoff is if you use the IMU as a measurement,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.930
you have to put a lot more stuff into the state vector,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.280
and those Jacobians get even bigger.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.169
I encourage you to discuss this decision on the Slack channels,

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.659
and if you're feeling ambitious,

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.000
you can even try to implement an estimator using a different strategy on your own
