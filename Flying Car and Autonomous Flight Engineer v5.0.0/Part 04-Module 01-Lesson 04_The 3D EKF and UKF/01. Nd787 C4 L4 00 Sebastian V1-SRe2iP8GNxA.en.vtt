00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
So, now just to make your life a little bit messier,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.410
we are going to go to a real drone,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.100
and the real drone will have a seven dimensional state-space to load,

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.879
and the robot will now navigate in a 3D space, okay.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.350
So, what this does to you is makes these matrices,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.844
the [inaudible] matrices much, much more messy.

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:21.589
We're going to do Kalman filters, extended Kalman filter,

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.420
and then there's a technique called unscented Kalman filter,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.570
which is my favorite technique. Why unscented?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.769
Many years ago in Sydney, in Professor Durant Whyte's lab,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.810
there were students that hated the unscented Kalman filter.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.575
It's so hard to implement,

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:40.030
and it's smallest amount of error [inaudible] estimator.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.785
This filter stinks.

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:44.109
They came up with a technique that's easier to

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.615
implement and works much better in practice,

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:48.905
and called it the unscented Kalman filter.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.880
That's why it's called unscented.
