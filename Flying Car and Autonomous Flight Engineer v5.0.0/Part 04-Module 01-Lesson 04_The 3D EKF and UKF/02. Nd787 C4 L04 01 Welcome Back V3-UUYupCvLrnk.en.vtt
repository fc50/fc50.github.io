00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Welcome back. This lesson is going to be broken into two parts.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.750
In the first part,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.339
we're going to do a conceptual walk-through of

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:13.684
the 3D state estimator that you're going to implement in C++ for your final project.

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:18.240
As we do this, you'll also be implementing some of the logic in Python.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.073
Once we've gone through 3D state estimation,

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.970
there's one more variant of the Kalman filter that I'm

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.594
going to show you called the unscented Kalman filter.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.919
The unscented Kalman filter is

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.310
an even fancier math trick than the extended Kalman filter,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.725
but it actually winds up being easier to implement than the EKF,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.265
and it works better too.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.545
But we'll get more into the EKF at the end of the lesson.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:47.215
For now, let's focus on the moment we've all been waiting for,

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:52.480
implementing state estimation in three dimensions on a real drone.
