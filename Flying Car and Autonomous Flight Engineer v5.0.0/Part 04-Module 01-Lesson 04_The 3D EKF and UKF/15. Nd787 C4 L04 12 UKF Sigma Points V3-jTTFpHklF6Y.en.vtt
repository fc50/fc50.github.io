00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
So, how do we get these special Sigma points?

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:08.339
We can't just symmetrically sample any points around the mean.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.019
In order for the math underlying the UKF to work out,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.744
we need to choose the right points.

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:18.559
In fact, if we have an N dimensional state space,

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:23.250
we're going to need to generate two times N plus one Sigma points.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.990
The first Sigma point is just going to come from the mean.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.429
If I were doing this in one dimension,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.534
that would mean my first Sigma point is here.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:36.794
Then my remaining two points might be at the mean plus

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:41.684
the standard deviation and the mean minus the standard deviation.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:45.244
To calculate Sigma points in higher dimensions,

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.669
I first need to calculate S,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
which is the square root of the covariance matrix.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.549
Remember, this will be an N by N matrix.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.849
So, this S matrix will have N rows.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.085
I'm going to refer to row number I as S_i.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.170
You can think of this like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.390
a multidimensional version of a standard deviation in one dimension.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.724
Now that I have S with rows given by S_i.

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:16.719
I'm going to get my Sigma points according to this math here.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.329
This just says, I should take my first point to be

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.715
the mean and then I should sample N points like this,

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:29.365
where each point is sampled by stepping some distance away from the mean.

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:32.809
The size of that step is set by Gamma and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.620
the direction is given by row I of the S matrix.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.965
Of course, I also have to do something similar

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.240
in the opposite direction to make the sampling symmetric.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:48.875
Eventually, we're going to use all of these Sigmas to try to recover the mean

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.530
and covariance of the samples once we

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.864
pass them through the measurement and transition models.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.114
When we perform that averaging,

00:01:57.114 --> 00:02:00.619
we aren't going to count all of the Sigma points equally.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.150
Each one will have a weight we use for the mean calculation given by these equations.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.319
Note here, the superscript N to denote that this weight is used for

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.009
the mean calculation and each Sigma point will

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.784
also have a separate weight associated with the covariance calculation.

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:23.349
We'll explain more about the details of

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.969
this math and some other parameters in the text below this video.
