00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
As I said before,

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.375
we're going to be using something called a complimentary filter for attitude estimation.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.615
So, we might as well get that out of the way first.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:13.949
For a real quadrotor to fly in three-dimensions,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.524
it's crucial that it have a really accurate estimate of it's attitude.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.348
Small mistakes in roll and pitch estimates especially,

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.109
can lead to some really bad behaviour.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.179
The basic idea behind

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.144
a complimentary filter is that we're going to use two measurements of attitude.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:36.195
One, which comes from the accelerometer and a second,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.630
which comes from the rate gyros.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.515
Neither of these measurements alone can provide

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.375
a reliable and responsive attitude estimate.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.289
But taken together, the two sensors compliment each other,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.475
and we can get a good estimate of attitude.

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:56.015
The accelerometer measures attitude because it can tell you which way is down,

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.899
and that's because of gravity,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.375
which we know always points down.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.829
Then if the drone feels an acceleration vector which is inclined,

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.010
there's a good chance,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.579
that means the drone itself isn't level.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.109
We can use this to figure out the roll and the pitch.

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.390
Now, there are some caveats here,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.969
but the key idea is that when we average the acceleration over long time scales,

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.289
It should point down,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.300
and we can use that reference down to measure attitude.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.659
Unfortunately, any individual accelerometer measurement is pretty noisy.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109
So, over long time scales,

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.179
the accelerometer is good,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.485
but it's not very responsive to sudden changes in attitude.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:42.019
The rate gyros on the other hand,

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.450
give really good measurement of the angular rates,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.954
and these can be integrated to get the attitude.

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.280
These measurements aren't very noisy.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
But since they get integrated they are susceptible to a drift over time.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.064
So, this means the rate gyros are responsive,

00:01:58.064 --> 00:02:01.590
but they aren't useful over long time scales.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.405
So, we have accelerometer measurements that are good over long time scales,

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.115
and gyro measurements that are good over short time scales.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:15.480
We want to combine these measurements intelligently so that we can have

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:20.399
an estimate of attitude that is both accurate and responsive.
