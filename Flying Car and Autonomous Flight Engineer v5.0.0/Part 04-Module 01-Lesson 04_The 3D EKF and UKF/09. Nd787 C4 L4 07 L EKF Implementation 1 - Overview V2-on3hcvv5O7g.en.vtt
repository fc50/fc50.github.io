00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Now that we have the complimentary filter implemented,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.695
you should be able to estimate the roll and the pitch in the global frame.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.070
So, we're just going to assume that's happening all the time,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.765
and we just know roll and pitch now as a result of that estimation process.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:21.440
Now, I like to walk through some of the actual EKF implementation details.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.400
We'll be providing you with a document that goes over all of this in detail,

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.419
and you may find that more useful than listening to me explain everything,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.175
but let's walk through that document as well.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:37.594
So, here I am in the section called three dimensional quad.

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.899
Now, in the event that we make some changes to this document after I record this,

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.949
it's worth noting that some of the details of what you see here may change.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.770
So, things like the section and equation numbers that you see in this video might change.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.090
I also want to mention that there's a lot of math here,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.275
and it's possible that there are some mistakes in the draft I'm recording with here.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.699
If we find mistakes,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.909
we will make sure to update the document that we distribute.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.879
So, if you have any doubts just make sure you consult the document.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:12.364
With that out of the way, let's dive in.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.259
As I already mentioned,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.734
we're representing the state at time t with these variables,

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:23.150
and the control input at time t with these variables.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.780
This control input will be getting from the IMU which is weird, but it works.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.079
Note the superscript B and all of these variables

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.739
which indicates that these are given in the body frame.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.140
Since these are in the body frame,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.170
we need a rotation matrix that converts from the body frame to the world or global frame,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.239
and that should look pretty familiar.
