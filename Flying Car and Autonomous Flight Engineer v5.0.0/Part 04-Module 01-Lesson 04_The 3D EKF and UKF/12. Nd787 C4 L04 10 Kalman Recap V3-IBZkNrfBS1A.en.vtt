00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.203
Now that we know how to implement state estimation in 3D,

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:08.400
let's move on to the second part of this lesson where I will

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.970
introduce you to another variant of the Kalman Filter,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.649
called the unscented Kalman filter before I do that,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.919
let's do a quick recap of Kalman filters.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.030
A Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm that can be

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.995
used to estimate the state of a system that cannot be measured directly.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:36.730
A Kalman filter is defined for a linear system with a linear state transition model,

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.444
and a linear measurement model.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.865
But this is a very specific situation.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.940
In general both the state-transition function

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.254
and the measurement function could be non-linear.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:52.895
I want to demonstrate this difference with a picture.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:57.180
The Kalman filter assumes a Gaussian distribution.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.840
When the state transition function or the measurement function is linear,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.094
and we pass the state into the transition function,

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:07.429
the distribution stays Gaussian,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.295
even though the mean and covariance will have changed.

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:14.954
But when the transition function is non-linear,

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:18.524
the resulting distribution will not be Gaussian.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:22.560
The extended Kalman filter handles this by first

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.045
linearizing the system around the mean of the current estimate,

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.840
then the EKF uses linear approximations of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.799
the state transition and measurement functions to update its estimate.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.935
So, this works well when the G or

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:42.060
H function can be well approximated by a linear function,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.480
but there are some drawbacks to EKFs.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.950
Consider what happens when the state transition function looks like this.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.799
In this region, the function is not well represented by a linear approximation at all.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.989
This is one situation where unscented Kalman filters are really useful
