00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
For those following along who have the Intel Aero.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video we will walk through a couple checks to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.330
make sure the aero software is up to date and fully ready to go.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.970
We can communicate with the Intel Aero by

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.760
connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot that it generates.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.190
And that's going to be the way that we're going to get information

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.730
down from the aero and commands up to the aero.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.089
Using that same hotspot we can actually login to

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.765
the computer itself to make sure that the software is up to date.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.329
So to do that, we're going to turn on our drone,

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.137
and it takes a couple minutes for it to boot up and get the computer up and running.

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:41.229
In the meantime what we're going to do is we're going to navigate

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.140
to our network settings to be able to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.314
find and wait for the Wi-Fi hotspot generated by the Intel Aero to come online.

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:57.280
Here we go, so here we can look at our list of network names and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.195
we'll see one that starts with an aero dash as the prefix,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.405
for any of you who might have something that looks different,

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:10.344
now another option is that it might say AP or CAP dash and then long number here.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:15.219
If you don't have aero dash as the prefix to the Wi-Fi hotspot it means that

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.650
the Intel Aero is running an outdated version of

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.205
the software and you'll need to go ahead and update the software.

00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:26.679
So for updating the software the Intel has a pretty detailed Wikipedia with

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.320
tutorials on how to update different software and

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.709
navigate parts of the Intel Aero computer.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.853
Provided that you have the correct firmware,

00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:39.394
or software, we can connect to the network.

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:44.045
Again Intel has in their detailed documentation here,

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:52.129
a page all about network that reminds you of what the password is to the Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:56.030
So, they also list the IP address of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.299
the drone so that what we're going to go ahead and connect to.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.409
So we'll SSH into the drone and the only user is root,

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.274
so we'll SSH as root.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:11.719
So we'll go ahead and connect as root to the Intel Aero.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.074
So now we are the SSH-ed into the Intel Aero itself.

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:18.134
So this is the computer that runs on-board of our drone.

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:21.359
This computer manages that network connection to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.590
the ground and it also manages the running of the autopilot on-board.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.159
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to check to make sure that

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.122
we have the most up to date version of the software,

00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:37.574
and with that Intel provides a simple script to be able to test,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.500
to be able to print out the version information and that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.655
going to be aero-get-version.py,

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:50.640
which is also shown here in their tutorial.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:03:00.384
So now we'll run that. And we can see that we're running aero version 1.00.13.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:10.557
It has the flight control firmware version is 1.6.5 which at the time of this recording,

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:14.680
this is the most up to date version of the software and this is what you will

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.330
need to be running in order for backyard flyer to work properly on the aero.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.730
If this is not the version number,

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.899
specifically if these top portions don't match

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.340
with what I have on my screen here or with what Intel shows as the most recent version,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.300
then please go ahead and follow this initial setup Wiki that

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.406
they have and instructions to update your software.

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:46.129
You'll notice this last line says flight control firmware version and that's

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.284
just telling us the version of the autopilot that's running currently.

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:53.585
And so by default it runs the PX4 autopilot,

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:55.805
and should provide a number like that.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:58.610
If for whatever reason it doesn't seem to be running

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.745
PX4 or it seems to have a different version number,

00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:10.930
we can update just the autopilot software itself by running this set of commands.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.150
If your version information matches this are the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.000
most up-to-date version on Intel's website,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.529
then means we are good to go and we can move on to the next step.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.384
Before we can fully fly backyard flyer on our drone,

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:26.649
we will need to configure PX4,

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.204
the autopilot that's running on board but for that,

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:31.750
we'll be using a ground control software.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.139
So see you in the next video for that.
