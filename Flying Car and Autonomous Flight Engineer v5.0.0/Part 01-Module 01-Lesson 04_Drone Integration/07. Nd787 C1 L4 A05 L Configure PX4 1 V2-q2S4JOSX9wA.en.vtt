00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
So let's head back to that settings tab and let's make sure

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.974
that we've got our autopilot configured in the way we want.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:11.114
First thing down this list of interests is the sensors tab.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.095
Just say okay to that.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.774
In the sensors, it's going to tell you the state of calibration for our compass,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.529
or gyro, the accelerometers,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.780
what we define as level,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.630
and here you'll see you've got green dots down the line

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.869
which means everything has been calibrated and taken care of.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.160
However, as I mentioned,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.884
if you just installed the autopilot,

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.134
these may have some red dots appear.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.524
And in those cases,

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:40.325
what you'll need to do is click the appropriate sensor,

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.410
and walk through the configuration.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.879
In this window here,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.108
it'll show you the steps you need to take,

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:48.844
and it will walk you through the calibration process.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:50.960
So the next one down the line is radio.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.420
And the intel arrow should already come configured with the radio calibrations,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.185
but in case it isn't or if you have your own drone,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.638
you'll want to go ahead and make sure you calibrate the radio,

00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:05.855
and once again it will walk you through that calibration process.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:09.020
We're taking a quick stop through this page though because it's

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.724
a great way to monitor and look to make sure that everything's working.

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:18.515
So, for example as I move the throttle we'll see that throttle dot increase and decrease,

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.769
and the same for roll, pitch, and yaw.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.569
Why we stopped here is before we go on to configuring our flight modes,

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.414
we want to know what switches we have access to.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:33.355
And you may not know exactly how the radio is configured so that we can do is we can

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:37.060
go through and toggle some of the different switches on our radio.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.234
For example, as I toggle this one,

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:43.539
we notice that channel five moves.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.420
And we get actually an urgent notification,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.640
which we'll ignore for the moment.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.465
And as I change this switch,

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.879
I've got channel seven.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.329
As I move the other switches,

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.569
I don't see other channels go so that tells me I have channels

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.654
five and seven have switches that will allow me to configure my flight modes,

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.724
which we'll go ahead and do now.

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:10.935
So, most likely when you came to the flight modes tab,

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.884
you were visited with a screen like this.

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:17.069
And it allows you to assign different flight modes to those three positions.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.544
However it's a little bit limited because it only allows us to choose three options.

00:02:22.544 --> 00:02:27.030
So what we're gonna do is use this multi-channel mode selection.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.520
This allows us to couple switches on

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.550
channel five and seven to give us a wider range of flight mode options.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.735
So we're gonna go ahead and do that and you'll see in the position I have it here,

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:40.655
it says it's stabilized main.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:43.039
So now what happens is that channel five

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.590
switch which is a three positions which allows us

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.650
to choose between main, assisted, and mission.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.039
We won't be using mission,

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.250
this is the PX4 mode that allows you to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.050
execute those missions that you can configure up in this A to B tab.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.885
Assist now defaults to using channel seven that second switch,

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:11.754
to be able to configure a second kind of set of flight modes.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.349
So in this case, we can be in

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.949
an assisted mode in either altitude hold or position control.

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.569
And that's the way I have it configured.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.174
I've changed, you can slide these for changing the thresholds.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:27.340
So I can toggle between altitude and position control now,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.564
and then finally I've set the last position in the switch

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:35.620
to be, I set it to channel seven to be off board control.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.200
And you'll keep seeing as we get these notifications

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.424
reject position control or reject off-board control.

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.795
We can go ahead and take a look at those.

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:47.959
The reason those are being rejected right now is that we don't have GPS.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.305
In order to be in either position control or off-board,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:56.120
the autopilot is using GPS in the loop to make decisions.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.275
So, it won't allow you to be in those modes if you don't have GPS.

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:02.569
Altitude hold actually just uses

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.349
the barometer on-board so it doesn't need GPS in order to work,

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.259
which is why it allows us to go into altitude hold.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.289
Well let's bring it back into manual and I don't know if you've

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.215
noticed up here as I switch through these,

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:18.709
the mode is displayed appropriately at the top.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.214
So now we have our switches configured,

00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:25.169
and that allows us to switch through the different flight modes which will

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.935
be tremendously helpful when we go outside and actually fly.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.925
The next one that we're going to look at is power.

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:36.424
And this is just to make sure that if you're flying a three-cell battery,

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:39.890
you've properly marked up three-cells or if you're flying a four-cell battery,

00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:41.760
you've made that four-cells.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.389
This just makes it possible for

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.414
the battery status to display correct information about the percentage.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.814
If you have the wrong configuration here,

00:04:52.814 --> 00:04:58.115
it may overestimate or underestimate the amount of flight time that you have remaining.

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:02.139
Finally, we're going to make a couple optional changes.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.300
We're going to go down to this parameters tab.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.915
And this lists all the different possible parameters for the PX4 autopilot.

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:13.420
I'll leave it to you to kind of flip through

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.210
and get an idea of what different options there are,

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.189
but what we're going to go through is we're going to go

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.800
into this multicopter position control.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.650
These are the parameters that dictate the behavior of

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:27.939
our drone when it's under position control or autonomous control.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.879
So really this is a lot of dictation of

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.295
the behavior that will happen when your script is running.

00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:38.025
I'm going to make two changes in this file,

00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:42.914
purely for point of view safety and just to slow things down a little bit.

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:47.040
It'll give you more time to kind of react if something goes wrong,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.439
and just more time to enjoy watching Backyard Flyer do its thing.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.785
So we're going to go ahead and change this MPC_XY_CRUISE.

00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:58.990
So this is the cruise velocity.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.129
This is the speed at which it's going to move in the XY plane.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.725
And we're going to bring that down to four meters per second,

00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.890
which sounds slow but it definitely allows you

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.870
to really watch and see what's happening with the drone while it's flying.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.209
So we'll hit save on that,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.495
and then we'll go down and change that maximum velocity.

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:23.072
We'll bring that down to five meters per second,

00:06:23.072 --> 00:06:25.000
and we'll go ahead and save that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.709
As you get more comfortable with flying your drone,

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:31.620
feel free to increase these numbers and see just how

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.949
quickly the arrow can actually fly the Backyard Flyer loop.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.084
But for now, we'll keep things nice and slow.

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:40.814
So with those last configuration changes made,

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:42.975
we are good to go.

00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:44.445
We're ready to fly,

00:06:44.444 --> 00:06:46.844
provided we were outside with GPS.

00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:50.070
And now we can move on to making some changes to

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.909
the Backyard Flyer script to make sure it connects with our drone,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.035
and we'll change a couple of the state machine elements.

00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:00.420
But that's for the next video.
