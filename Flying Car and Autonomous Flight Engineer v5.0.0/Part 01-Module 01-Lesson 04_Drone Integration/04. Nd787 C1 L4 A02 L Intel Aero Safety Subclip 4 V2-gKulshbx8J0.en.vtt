00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
As a pilot, even for an autonomous vehicle like this,

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:05.835
you want to first check the air space to make sure it's clear.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.830
You want to know if there are other drones in the area that you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.012
need to avoid or other aircraft of any kind.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.449
The other thing is that, if is anybody with you on the ground,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:13.829
you want to make sure they know where to be.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.545
They should never be between you and the drone.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.410
You should always be able to see your vehicle at all times.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.640
Ideally, there's a line on the ground that people know to stay behind.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.149
Yep, and also in addition to that line,

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.309
don't fly over people or over buildings,

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.349
and try and find open space.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.440
Good.
