00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
Adrien, we're ready to go.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:03.780
Why are we not flying it?

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.000
It's always nice to, kind of bench test to make sure

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.609
it works here before we go out and fly it.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.559
Last thing you want to do is have everything set up,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.480
be out on the field, turn on, it doesn't work.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.019
Okay, we're going to do this with the props off.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.710
Yeah, it's the safest thing.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.250
If you're going to be right next to it,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.355
you don't necessarily want these to start spinning up,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.484
and do something that you don't expect,

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:23.989
maybe come and hit you.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.599
So, it's always the nicest to take them off, set them on the bench.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.545
Especially, if there are other quad-rotors around,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.320
you wouldn't want somebody else's transmitter to bind

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.130
to your vehicle and take off with the props on.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.323
Very much, so.

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:35.149
All right, cool. So, what's first?

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.359
So, first things first,

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.719
we'll turn on our transmitter.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.204
So, we're going to have control when we turn it on.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.844
We'll turn on our Aero.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:44.110
Okay.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.765
And that's going to take a minute to boot up.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.582
And it creates a Wi-Fi hotspot that we're going to connect to,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.564
and that's what's going to allow us to control and send different commands.

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:55.169
And this is very similar even,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.579
if you don't have an Intel Aero,

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.234
if you have one of the 3D robotics vehicles,

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:01.019
or if you even have a DJI vehicles,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.150
doing very similar things.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.161
Yep.

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:08.739
Your password is 1-2-3-4-5?

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.354
No. It is always helpful when you log in.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.590
Well done. I've got to change my login now.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.355
So, couple of things I'm checking are,

00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:21.093
one, up here, just to look at the fact that we have got GPS.

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.048
So, right now we've got 17 satellites.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.882
And we've got a GPS lock.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:26.050
It's a pretty good position.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:26.206
Great.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.209
So, we're showing up. The other things,

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.524
I'm just going to double check is that,

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.240
my mode switches are configured the way I want.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.564
So, mode switches allow me, as the pilot,

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:39.370
to change the control methods of the drone.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.936
So, whether I'm flying manually or in something called altitude hold.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.605
So, where it's holding altitude or position control,

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.170
where it's holding position or most importantly,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.939
off board, which gives the script the control of the drone.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.909
So, I like to just quickly look here.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.021
It says manual.

00:01:56.022 --> 00:02:00.878
It says altitude position,

00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:04.420
and then, it's going to reject off-board because it does run when it needs to.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.930
So, I just always like to double check that my switches are configured the way we want.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.437
Great.

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:11.865
So, I'm confident everything's working well on autopilot here.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.890
So, we're going to close out a key ground control.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.734
All right, so now, we're ready to run the script.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.300
So, we're going to run the script and so, it's just going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.930
wait there for everything to be set,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.143
for the pilot to give it control,

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:22.539
and then, it should take off.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.909
Terrific.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.259
So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to arm the motors.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.379
You see the motor started to spin and they're just idling.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.409
And then, I'm going to give control of the vehicle to the script.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.264
We see the motors spins, so it's armed.

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:39.319
And then, we hear the motor spin up.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.319
As it's trying to take off.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.030
Script actually fix as trying to run the vehicle.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.479
Of course, a vehicle without the props on,

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.079
can't actually do the mission right now.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.990
So, great, let's stop this.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.564
And I'm actually, going to take it.

00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:54.990
So now, I've taken it out of control.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.760
I've killed the motors. Now, I can turn off the script.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.324
Great.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:00.049
So now, we know everything works.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.510
We can put the props on and go fly the mission for real.

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.610
Yep.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.139
Let's go do that.

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.199
Let's do it.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.894
All right. So, Adrian, we're here,

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.960
we got the vehicle on the pad with the props on, ready to go?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.570
Yeah. So, you can go ahead and get that script started.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.939
Okay, before we do that, let's check to make sure the airspace is clear.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.849
See, no one else is flying right now.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.989
Nope.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.740
And everyone is well behind us.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.935
Great.

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.530
And we can see on the screen that the vehicle

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.449
is on the overhead map where we expect it to be.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.359
Good. All right, I will go ahead and start the script.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.825
And now, I'm going to arm the motors,

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:32.849
and now, I'm going to give control of the vehicle to the script.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.609
I see the motors armed.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.100
And there we go, and it's taking off.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.019
Going to three meters.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.380
And now, it's off to its first waypoint.

00:03:44.379 --> 00:04:06.409
First waypoint, second waypoint,

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.889
third waypoint,

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.919
and coming home.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.019
Very nice.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.004
So, now I'll take control of the drone again.

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.300
So, I can then disarm it manually.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.783
Okay, I'll kill the script.

00:04:34.783 --> 00:04:36.949
There we go.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.555
And that's another difference between what we've done with this script here,

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:41.875
and what we see on the simulator.

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:44.677
On the simulator, once it detects it's landed,

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:47.403
it will disarm the motors and kill the script.

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:49.150
While here, we're going to leave it to

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.399
the pilot to take back control of disarming the motors.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.000
All right, terrific. And nice work on the autopilot.
