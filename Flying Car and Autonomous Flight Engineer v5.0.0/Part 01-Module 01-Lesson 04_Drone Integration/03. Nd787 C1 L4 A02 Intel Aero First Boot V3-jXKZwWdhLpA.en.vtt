00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
All right, what's next?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.099
We just need to plug this guy in and then.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:06.209
Let's take the props off now.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.120
Yup. When you plug it in,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.599
you always want to make sure this cable can't be hit by a propeller.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.459
So, for example, the way we have it plugged in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.375
now is probably not the way you'll want to plug it in when we fly.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.250
I find it's actually pretty useful.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.704
You can run this connector through one of the legs.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:31.129
So, you can bring it around and run the battery connected through one of the legs.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.185
And you can see now that the cable is,

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:36.760
no matter how much it moves,

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:40.174
its not going to hit the propeller.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.744
So, always before we turn on the drone,

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:44.349
we want to be able to turn on our remote.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.079
So, we'll turn that on first. Big power switch.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.991
All right.

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:53.739
Throttle should always be down before you turn on the drone.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.020
Part of the reason we're doing this is to make

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.780
sure that we are going to be the ones in control of our drone.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.600
The last thing you want is to turn this on and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.754
some other guys remote to pair with your drone and all of a sudden they have control.

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:09.664
So, that's on, we'll turn our arrow on,

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.750
and give it a minute to boot up.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.180
How do we know when it's done booting?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.330
We'll actually see a Wi-Fi network

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.959
that's generated by this vehicle that we'll be able to connect to.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.029
For other systems usually,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.549
it's flashing light, an auditory signal.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.129
Most have some way to communicate from the drone to the ground. Connecting.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:33.349
Shall we do a motor spin test?

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:34.099
Yes, we can.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.063
All right.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:40.294
Here we go. And if you want to throttle up,

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:43.716
you'll be able to hear the motors speed up.

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:47.324
This is why you don't put the props on indoors,

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.554
because if I armed the motors accidentally,

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:52.799
and then I hit the throttle up, the vehicle will take off.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.959
Yup.
