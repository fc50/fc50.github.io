00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.812
Can I go ahead and fly?

00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:04.070
Still one more thing.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.530
We've talked that there are different kinds of control modes.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.929
There are different ways that you can fly or

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.765
different ways that your input can affect the vehicle.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.044
One of the most basic ways is manual,

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.259
which means every piece of information I put in is going directly,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.105
more or less, to the motors.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.810
It means that it's not going to try and hold the position.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:25.834
It's not going to try and hold an altitude.

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:27.690
It'll drift, it'll bounce around.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.790
So that's kind of the lowest level of control.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.207
But the attitude loop is all the way running.

00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:32.601
Correct, yes.

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.914
So the vehicles, you don't have to worry about keeping the vehicle level.

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:35.390
Correct.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.487
That part will always work.

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:39.994
Yes. And then, there are a couple other modes that

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:45.059
I've configured the arrow to use that I recommend.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.830
One is called altitude control.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.585
So, what that does is it takes

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.957
you having to worry about the throttle out of the equation.

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:52.549
It holds a fixed altitude.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.797
So while you're flying you can then focus on just where its horizontal position.

00:00:57.798 --> 00:00:59.825
Note, that it still will drift with the wind.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.750
It's not trying to hold this specific position.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.914
So on a windy day, you've got to be careful,

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:06.914
or else it will get away from you.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:08.720
The next one is position control.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.469
And what now, we're doing is adding

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.370
just one more control loop that the autopilot is taking care of.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.870
It's going to try and hold the position.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.150
So now my commands are really just moving

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.385
around this fixed point that it's going to hold.

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.025
So on a windy day, should stay fixed.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.805
The last mode, this can be of interest to something called off-board control,

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:28.800
and that's you as a pilot,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.024
releasing control to the computer,

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.939
to our backyard flyers script.

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:35.689
So it's always called off-board mode, I know that.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.536
It's kind of a misnomer, cause its really it's on-board control, isn't it?

00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:41.700
That's well, I mean, it's off-board of the main auto pilot board,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.049
it's a secondary computer.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.036
Off-board this, on-board there.

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:45.849
Yeah. Correct.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.206
Very good.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:50.159
And so one thing that we can do is we've got

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.444
some of these switches are set up to change between those modes.

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:57.864
So we can look on the ground station to make sure that as I flip the switches,

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:00.149
it's correctly cycling between

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.000
the desired modes and rejecting the modes that it can't go into yet.
