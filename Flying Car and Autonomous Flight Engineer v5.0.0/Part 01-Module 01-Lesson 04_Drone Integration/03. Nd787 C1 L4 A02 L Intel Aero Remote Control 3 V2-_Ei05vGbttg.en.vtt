00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
So, some of the basic controls you need to know just

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.615
to get started is arming and disarming.

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:06.990
So, that's going to be getting the motors ready to take

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.518
commands and releasing the motors from that state.

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:14.070
So, down into the right is going to arm the motors which gets them to start spinning.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.350
And when you want to kind of turn everything off,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.810
it's going be down and to the left.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.644
And down to the right again to arm.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:26.300
And I have throttle up and make the vehicle take off.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.574
I can yaw and fly at high speed into the wall to the right,

00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:34.399
fly at high speed into the wall to the left.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.449
The only other set of switches on here that's going to be important to know,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.350
are going to be the way we have it configured it's going to be these two switches.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.539
Will the students running the same script have

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.030
the same configuration or do they have to know how to configure it?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.120
One of the screencasts is to walk into the configuration,

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.179
so it's going to be through queue ground control.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.789
We're actually able to change the configurations on the autopilot and one of them

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.744
is to configure the switches to be able to change different control modes.

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:01.699
So one of the things you're going to want to do is go through

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.344
that configuration process before you take your vehicle outside.

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:07.939
Very much so. So, we've got two sets of

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.439
switches are going to help us get

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.719
through all the different states that we're going to want.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.609
When this switch is all the way towards you,

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.450
when both this switches are all the way towards you.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.730
This one and this one.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.530
Correct.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.625
That's going to be manual control.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:24.484
So, that's going to be the most basic amount of input that you can get.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.176
This top switch in middle position,

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:31.424
is what we are going to call our main assisted modes.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.534
So, middle position bottom that's going to be altitude mode.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.009
So, the vehicle is going to try and hold

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.140
its altitude which means you don't have to worry as much about the throttling input.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.820
But it will drift left and right. Correct.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.284
Middle position is position control.

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:48.500
And that means it's going to be working to hold its position.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.137
So, when you release your hand from all the commands,

00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:54.055
it should hold where it is and not drift with any wind.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:57.208
And then finally, when it's time to turn that script on

00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:59.900
all the way up, puts it into off-board control.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.145
So, that releases control from you the pilot, to the computer.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:11.316
So, a process that I might go through is a fully manual mode.

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:16.849
Arming the vehicle, put it in an assist mode.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.313
And now, I'm in off-board mode,

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:22.219
puts all the control, on-board the vehicle, and then we start our script.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.210
Correct.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.640
Very good.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.919
Normally, you want to bring it back to manual before you disarm.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.379
All right. Good point.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.924
So, everything that we have here, this remote,

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:36.570
this vehicle, it's specifically for this this drone.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.430
There are many different ones out there that you can get.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.885
Most remotes actually do look more or less the same.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:44.549
You're always have these two joysticks and some collection of switches.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.860
So for your vehicle,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.925
if you have your own custom build at home,

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:50.778
your switches may be configured differently,

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:55.060
and maybe you prefer to have right handed versus a left handed system.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.735
But what's nice is with this autopilot,

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:00.530
if this doesn't really work for you in that screencast,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.334
we'll show you how to configure it.

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:04.979
So, if you want to change up the switches,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.030
you definitely can to something that's a little bit more your style.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.030
Great.
