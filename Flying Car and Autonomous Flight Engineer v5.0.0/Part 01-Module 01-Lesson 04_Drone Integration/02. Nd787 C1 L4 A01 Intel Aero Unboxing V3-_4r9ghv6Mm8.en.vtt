00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Now, that you've been through the backyard Flyer Project,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:07.290
you've had a chance to implement a simple planning, control strategy for your vehicle,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.970
but only in simulation.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.899
We set it up, so that you can also run it on a real vehicle.

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.868
And to help me get your software onto a real vehicle,

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.114
I'd like to introduce my friend, Adrien.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.099
Adrien, you are a Ph.D. student at Stanford, right?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400
I am, by practice.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.549
Yep, but you're also a drone expert.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150
I am. Well, expert, it's a tough word to use.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.670
I've been around drones for quite a while.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.710
So since, I've been about 12, I've been flying.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.259
Initially, it was just fixed wings.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.829
I used to build some of them, and then,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.589
realized that I enjoyed flying them a lot more than building them.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.300
And it was easier to just buy them, and then fly them.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:48.134
And I used to do kind of tricks and acrobatics basically with fixed wings.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:50.489
And then, five years ago,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.140
when I started at Stanford,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.859
I found a project that required using, kind of a quadcopter.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.299
And I figured, well,

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.939
if I'm going to kind of do something on a quadcopter,

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.695
I should probably learn how to fly those.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.980
So, I've been flying quads for the past, probably five years.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.930
Do you know Adam Bry from Skydio from under the program?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.083
I'm not familiar.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:10.560
I think I've heard his name before but.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.049
Yes, he's a former grad student of mine and he's background is very similar to yours.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.709
He started building vehicles and he's very young,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.244
and competed and then,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.155
went to grad school and worked with me for a while.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:24.329
So, Adrien, what we got here?

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.370
This is the Intel Aero.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.314
It's called the Ready to Fly Drone.

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:31.015
So, it's about everything you need to fly, right in the box.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:32.745
It comes all together as one piece.

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:36.475
But this is just one of many different types of drones.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:38.819
There is somewhere, kind of much more do it yourself,

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.914
where you buy a frame here, and an autopilot there, and you put it together.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:43.925
But this is what we're going to work with today.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:47.414
I should note that while we're working with this today for our script,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:50.580
that same script is going to be able to work with any

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.579
of the PX4 family of drones, right out of the box.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.435
And we're working to try and get integration to maybe some of those other platforms,

00:01:57.435 --> 00:01:59.210
like what you see from Parrot or DJI,

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.864
or some other manufacturers.

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:03.664
So, this is just an option. If you happen to have a drone,

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.950
the software that you've written so far should work on one family of drones,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.525
and we'll try and make it work for everybody's drones.

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:11.879
All right. Can we open it up?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.930
Let's do it.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.025
All right. Man, this thing is really sealed tight.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.395
I wish there was some way that we could get this box cover off.

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:25.250
Thanks box fairy, that was awesome. All right, what do we have here?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.312
So, we've got our instruction manuals on top.

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:28.109
Instructions?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.600
Which you should read.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.245
And then, we've got our drone and our remote control.

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.740
Everything we're going to need to fly it.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.210
All right. Let's take the drone out first.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.540
Put that there.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:44.829
Do you want to grab the, and there is one extra box right there, as well.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.594
Box of tricks.

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:47.594
All right.

00:02:47.594 --> 00:02:50.210
So, this should look fairly similar.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.969
It's got all the main components that you've already learned about.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:53.129
Okay.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.490
We've got our frame, that carries the four motors.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.740
Here, the speed control as we talked about,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.855
that control the motors, are a little bit hidden.

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:02.938
If we flipped them upside down, you can see them.

00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:05.014
There's one for each motor, one in each arm.

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:08.639
And then, we've got this big box in the center and that's

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.404
actually a combination autopilot and full computer.

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:13.860
So, in addition to being able to have

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.410
all those functionality that you get from an autopilot,

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.549
keep it stable and allow you to fly,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.920
we have, what they call,

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.664
a companion computer on-board.

00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:23.129
So, that's actually running on Ubuntu,

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.514
and you can run quite a lot of stuff on there,

00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:27.764
and that's going to be for later down the road.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:29.189
But for this first project,

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.409
we're not necessarily going to be using that.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.030
All right, terrific. What's that?

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.925
That's a power module.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:37.170
So, what that's taking

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.854
is going to be the power from the battery and converting the voltages

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.819
it needs for the computer to run and for all the motors.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.219
Okay.

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.590
And then, this big guy here is our GPS antenna.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.590
Let me screw that in there.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.509
And it sits on a mass,

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.344
nice and far from all the noise that you get,

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:58.530
all that kind of radio frequency interference that is generated by the motors,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.537
the speed control is by the computer, that's

00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:04.745
so we can get kind of a clean GPS signal for positioning.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.545
So, we've got our vehicle.

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:06.786
Yeah.

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:10.875
And we can't fly the vehicle without some way to give control commands.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.680
And that's what our remote control is for.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.820
Excellent.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.055
There's a lot of switches and knobs on there,

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.980
but for the most part, the important ones are the joysticks.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.485
Much like you would with a kind of game controller.

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:25.814
You've got throttle, for up down.

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:28.649
That's yaw to rotates our vehicle.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:30.539
We've got roll and pitch.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.138
So, that's going to be a way for us to physically,

00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:35.279
as a pilot, input commands to the vehicle.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.030
Although, with the software the students had written,

00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:38.639
they shouldn't need to use this very much.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.689
Correct.

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:40.879
Will they need it all?

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.949
They will need it to do some startup procedures.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.762
It's always safest to be able to have a way to fall back to manual control of vehicle.

00:04:49.762 --> 00:04:53.324
In case something goes wrong with the script or some odd behavior,

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:55.860
you want to be able to flip back and take control yourself.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.879
Okay. So, we'll hold on to this.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.009
And the last thing we have is propellers.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.699
Comes with plenty of spares.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.354
Not that any student has taken our Nanodegree would ever need a spare propeller.

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:12.379
So, we have two black and two silver. All right.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.259
And you'll see, they are color coordinated,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.724
and part of that,

00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:17.564
so the silver ones are going to go on the white tops,

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.209
black ones are going to go on black tops.

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:20.454
And part of that is,

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.305
since they're rotating in different directions,

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:26.355
you want the propeller to lock into the motor

00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:30.410
in a direction such that as the motor spinning, it won't unscrew.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.920
So, that's why it keeps it easy to color coordinate.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.210
So normally, we wouldn't be really putting the propellers on indoors.

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:42.444
Usually, you're going to do that outside, just before you take off.

00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:44.894
But just to demonstrate what it looks like fully built,

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:48.019
here is our quad almost all ready to go.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.000
You at least, would probably never want to have the props on,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.120
when the battery is in, until you were actually ready to fly.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.360
Yeah.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.089
Safety. Speaking of which, the battery.

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:02.199
So, that is one thing that doesn't come when you purchase an Intel Aero.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.185
So, you need to make sure that,

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:07.064
in addition to buying everything you see here,

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:11.574
you buy either a 3-cell or a 4-cell lithium polymer battery.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:13.379
Do you need to buy battery for this, as well?

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.569
Comes with batteries.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:15.949
This one comes with batteries.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.279
But the vehicle itself, does not.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.759
Correct.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.039
All right. So, if you want to get your laptop,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.359
we can order a battery from Amazon.

00:06:21.358 --> 00:06:23.634
It'll be here in two business days?

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.319
I wonder if there's an easier way to get a battery.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.224
Awesome. Thanks, battery fairy. There we go.

00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:33.240
So, this is a 3-cell battery,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.115
that is going to work with our quad.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:37.379
When you say 3-cells,

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.884
there's actually a three different batteries inside there.

00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:43.935
That's correct. And this will actually work with something also called the 4-cell.

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.610
which brings us to a conversation of what does 3-cell,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.285
4-cell even mean.

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:51.095
So, with lithium polymer batteries,

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:54.365
they're a little bit different than most of the different batteries that,

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:55.470
for example what's in here.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.260
Looks like four regular double A batteries.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.629
And the remote control needs four batteries.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.860
This thing needs basically,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.634
the equivalent of putting three in a row or four together.

00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:08.414
And what that's going to do is, just change the voltage that the battery is running at.

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:13.350
Motors and speed controllers are paired to work at specific voltages.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.520
And so, you can get batteries in a different set of voltages.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.430
Does that make it hard to charge the battery?

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.180
It does mean that when you charge the battery,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.660
you needed to charge it for a specific voltage.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.300
So, in this case, I need to charge it as a 3-cell battery.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.649
If I start to charge it as a four-cell battery,

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:33.670
that's when you can start to damage the battery and can cause other problems.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.444
So, battery safety is a big deal.

00:07:35.444 --> 00:07:37.894
And so, you do need to have the right charger.

00:07:37.894 --> 00:07:41.865
And if your battery ever becomes puffy and looks a little angry,

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:43.535
you need to dispose of it carefully.

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:46.465
Disposing it carefully means different things in different places,

00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:49.679
so you should either check with your local health and safety officer,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.365
if you're at a company, or you should consult

00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:55.910
your city on how to dispose of damaged lithium polymer batteries.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.965
They are very high energy density, very high power density.

00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:03.099
They're basically, like little munitions and they will explode if you're not careful.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.375
And in addition to charging at the right voltage,

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:09.855
there's this other big number that you usually see when you're buying batteries.

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:13.134
So, this is called a three-cell 4,000 milliamp power.

00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:16.615
Now, at 4,000 milliamp power is capacity. It's duration.

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:19.535
How long will effectively we'll be able to fly,

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:21.515
basically it's four amp powers.

00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:23.694
Bigger the number, the longer you can fly.

00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:25.365
But when you charge,

00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:27.400
it's also going to be a function of this number,

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:28.750
in addition to that voltage.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.029
So, for example, this 4,000 milliamp power battery,

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.845
you can charge safely at four amps.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.940
Once you start to push it to five, six, seven amps,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.810
that's when you can, again start to damage or destroy the battery.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.907
You're also perfectly safe to charge it at one amp.

00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:48.000
It'll just take four times as long to charge. Great.
