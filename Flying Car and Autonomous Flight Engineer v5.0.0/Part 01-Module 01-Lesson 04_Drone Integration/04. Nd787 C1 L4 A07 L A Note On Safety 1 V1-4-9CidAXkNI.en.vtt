00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.097
Before we do go outside,

00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:05.096
in addition to all the common sense safety things we've been talking about,

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:07.665
there are some regulatory issues you need to be aware of.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:09.435
Depending on which country you're in,

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.745
and even depending on which part of which country you're in,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.231
the rules may be different.

00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.769
And so, the first thing you have to do is, know before you fly.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.780
In the US, it's important that you follow the part 107 rules.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.890
Which means that you,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.510
as a pilot, especially,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
if you're doing anything that is not just your personal hobbyist entertainment,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.627
need to have an actual pilot's license for an autonomous vehicle.

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:34.230
And you can go on the FAA website,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.709
and you take a paper test and then, you're good to go.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.365
And if you are a hobbyist, you don't even need the part 107 license.

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:41.160
But it's really important that you actually

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.019
understand whether or not you're allowed to fly where you're planning to fly.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.450
A good guideline is,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.248
Adrien already mentioned, don't fly over people, don't fly over buildings.

00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:50.460
Another important guideline is,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.064
don't fly near airports.

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:54.629
Again, in the US, there are restrictions on how

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.030
close you can be to different kinds of airports,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.944
and you need to know what those are.

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:00.810
And in other countries, it may be different.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.405
Other regulatory issues?

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:03.495
The only thing that I would add is,

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:05.370
if you're strictly doing this as a hobbyist,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.192
as you pointed out, you don't need to get a specific license.

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:11.370
But you do need to follow a community set of guidelines if there are.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.725
So you can check out,

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:14.414
there's the Academy of Model Aeronautics.

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:17.220
They've got a lot of rules or guidelines,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.944
and then, either way,

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:21.245
you do need, what they call register your drone.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:23.069
It's a fairly painless process.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.119
You go online, you put your name,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.365
what kind of vehicle it is,

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:30.000
and you get a registration number that should be taped somewhere on the drone.
