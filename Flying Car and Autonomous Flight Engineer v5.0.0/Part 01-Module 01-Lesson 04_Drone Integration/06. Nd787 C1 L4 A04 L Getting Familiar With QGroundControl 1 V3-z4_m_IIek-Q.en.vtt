00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
Alright. So, one of the things we'll do to test out and

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.094
make sure everything is running properly on the autopilot is,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.929
I'm opening up a piece of software called, QGroundControl.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.750
This is an open-source ground station software.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.890
It's not like the simulator or what you've been interacting,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.880
what the students have been interacting with the simulator,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.500
and during the project.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.589
This is an open-source ground station that's used commonly

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.195
for a lot of these more DIY style drones.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.909
And what it does is, it gives us state information.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:38.854
It allows us to actually even see things like attitude information in real-time,

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:44.719
and other configurations that we might have to change from the defaults.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.909
This is the basic interface for QGroundControl,

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.704
and we've got our main window with our map,

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:52.564
that's going to display where our drone is,

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.844
and we've got a couple of tabs along the top.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:58.685
But really, there's not too much to look at until we connect a vehicle.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.250
So, let's go ahead and turn on our arrow,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.799
make sure remote control first and no propellers.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.670
And once that's on,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.135
and up and running, let's connect to its network.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.550
Once its connected, QGroundControl will

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.519
automatically see that a new drone has been connected,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.575
and will ask us to connect.

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:20.950
So, we'll go ahead and allow that connection, and now,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.484
you'll see we've got a few more options along the top,

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.254
and we've got this green loading bar.

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:27.399
Once that green bar goes all the way across,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.935
it means that all the parameters and settings

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:32.650
from the drone have been downloaded into QGroundControl.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.700
So, just to walk through the interface that we have in front of us here,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.770
I'm going to start from the top bar and work my way across.

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:43.009
This "Q" button here,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.675
this purple "Q" button is configuration files for Q ground control itself,

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.674
and also communication links.

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:53.584
So, if it didn't automatically connect,

00:01:53.584 --> 00:01:56.629
this is where you can manually add different types of links,

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:58.339
whether it's a serial connection,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.094
if you're using something like

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:06.804
a 3DR radio to connect to your drone or an internet-based connection.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:10.050
The next tab is going to be settings,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.465
and this is where you'll find all the information

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.182
about the autopilot settings and configurations.

00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.474
This is just a summary page that shows us

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:21.659
the quick view of all the different states and important information.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.259
You'll see there's a bunch of green dots along these tabs,

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.768
and that tells us things are configured and ready to go.

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.000
If you just installed the autopilot,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
you may notice some red circles,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.960
and that tells you that you need to configure

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.724
some parameters before the autopilot will let you take off.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:41.939
We got a whole list of different possible settings that we can look into,

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.125
which we'll come back to in a minute.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:48.500
The next tab is for being able to do

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.810
high-level planning to use the autopilot's inbuilt mission handling.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.259
We're actually not going to be using this tab for this Nanodegree,

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.364
however, feel free to explore this on your own.

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:03.350
The next tab is our main flight tab, and this is,

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.356
that's going to show us where our drone is currently on the map,

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:14.074
and information like our current orientation and heading speed, and other information.

00:03:14.074 --> 00:03:19.359
And finally, this tab allows us to connect and look at logs that are on board the vehicle.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.085
Again, we won't make too much use of this tab throughout this Nanodegree,

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.770
but it's just so you know it's there.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.240
Next, we have a bull horn for messages.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.219
Right now, there's no messages from the drone,

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.219
but this is where important information, for example,

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.229
it telling you something isn't calibrated,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.979
or mode changes will appear here.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.744
Next, we have our GPS status.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.525
Right now, we are inside,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:49.167
so it's going to show us that we're not connected to any GPS signals.

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:51.870
But normally, what you're going to be looking for before you take off,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.389
that you've got to account in above,

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.570
probably eight is what you'll see,

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.289
and these numbers will be much smaller around one or two.

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:05.384
This tells us the controller information,

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:08.084
the connection status to the remote control,

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:12.270
which is on, but seems to be not providing data at the moment.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.385
And finally, our battery status.

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:16.589
So, this is the voltage of our current battery,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.883
and it's going to go from 100 percent to somewhere around 30,

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:23.699
40 percent, you should most definitely be landing.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.579
This is our current flight mode that we have.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:27.959
Right now, we're in manual,

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:31.864
which means that the pilot has the most basic amount of control,

00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:34.870
and we'll be able to cycle through those different modes,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.170
things like altitude hold or position hold that we've mentioned

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.845
before as we change through those modes with our remote control,

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.750
that will be updated here accordingly.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.660
Finally, the armed versus disarmed state,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.200
and that tells us, "Are the motors ready to spin and take commands?"
