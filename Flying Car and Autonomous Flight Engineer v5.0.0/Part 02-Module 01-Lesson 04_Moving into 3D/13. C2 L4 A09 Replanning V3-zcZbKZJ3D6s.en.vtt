00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
Just as obstacles can pop up or disappear,

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:05.865
small inaccuracies in the position estimate

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.609
are another source of uncertainty for flying car.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.299
A real flying car is always going to encounter small disturbances and things

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.679
like how its rotors move or small disturbances from the environment like wind.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.725
This means that no matter how good the autopilot is,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:23.060
a real vehicle will never track a path perfectly.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:24.989
Dealing with small disturbances can

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.639
often be taken care of with a minor course correction.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.774
But in the case of large disturbances,

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:32.960
your planner may have to take more significant action.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.700
For example, suppose that your vehicle is hit by

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.785
a gust of wind or a steady prevailing wind and blown

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.819
far enough off course that there is now a building or

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.344
some other obstacle in the way on the path to the next waypoint,

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:50.429
your planner will need to re-plan and that isn't always an instantaneous process.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.500
So before re-planning, your state machine

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.884
may need to stop the vehicle and go into a hover,

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:56.817
or for a fixed-wing vehicle,

00:00:56.817 --> 00:01:00.030
do some other safety maneuver like go into a loiter pattern.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.630
The main point is that when a real flying vehicle is enroute to a waypoint,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.665
it needs to be constantly checking if

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:09.758
the flight path is still feasible from its current position.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:10.984
In the next lesson,

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:13.125
you'll get a chance to see the effect of wind

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.000
on your vehicle and detect the need to re-plan.
