00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Up to this point, you've looked at a couple of

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.055
different ways to solve the planning problem for flying cars.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.395
And you've been working in two-dimensions.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:10.185
We talked about 2D grids, and 2D graphs.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.795
But flying cars exist in three-dimensions.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:15.510
Now, we're going to take a look at how to actually solve

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.950
the planning problem for a three-dimensional vehicle in a three-dimensional world.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.845
Remember, the things you need in order to solve the planning problem are the state-space,

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.605
an action space, a cost function,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.420
and a start and goal state.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.010
To get at the state-space,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.845
you need to represent not just the geometry of the world in 3D,

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:36.235
but the configuration space.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.045
This is not always an easy task.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:40.100
Depending on the representation you choose,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.870
some tasks may become easier,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.505
and other tasks, harder.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:46.055
The computer graphics industry, in particular,

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:49.610
has looked at a lot of the problems with representing objects in three-dimensions.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.185
And you may have seen several of these issues previously if you ever worked in graphics.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.375
For the purposes of motion planning,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.060
what we care about in terms of a 3D representation

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.880
of the world is the same thing we cared about in 2D.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.940
Namely, whether or not a particular location in

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.545
the configuration space is free or occupied by an obstacle.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.000
Previously, we talked about how your configuration space is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.065
a function not only of the position of the vehicle but orientation as well.

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:17.640
For the purposes of flight,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.425
and particularly for quadrotors,

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:23.415
you can usually get away with using a simple 3D configuration space,

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.565
and ignore the effects of orientation or attitude.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:31.245
However, the truth is that in moving from two-dimensions to three-dimensions,

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.835
planning gets more expensive.

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:36.750
You'll have choices to make in terms of what you want to optimize for,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.115
which for the most part,

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:40.935
we'll come down to trade-offs in computational complexity,

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:44.350
and the completeness of your planning representation.
