00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
In this lesson, you crossed

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.780
the threshold into the third dimension of the planning problem.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.520
We looked at the fact that while 3D grids are highly expressive geometry,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.115
they can be prohibitively expensive to store in memory.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.415
You saw that if you're willing to give up a bit of that expressiveness,

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.470
you can get a huge advantage by going to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.930
a two and a half D representation of the problem.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.805
We looked at how you can use

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:24.705
random sampling to generate a representation of your state space,

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.345
and how, through connecting those random states with edges,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.155
you can form a probabilistic road map representation of your planning problem.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.560
With the tools in this lesson combined with previous lessons,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.520
you've actually got what you need to implement a receding horizon planning solution,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.324
where you create a course plan or heuristic over your entire space in 2D

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:46.950
then continuously re-plan over a local volume as you execute your flight plan.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.670
And with that, you're ready to complete the 3D motion planning project.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.160
You can actually skip the next lesson as it is not

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.770
required to implement a passing solution of the project.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.115
That said, if you want to take your planning project above and beyond,

00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:00.600
then consider including some of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.110
the advanced methods in the next lesson in your implementation.
