00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Moving into 3D.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.040
Since it's all about drones and flying cars,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.155
I brought my car here but it fly.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.859
Cars live effectively in a 1D environment.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.105
If you think of a highway,

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.054
it's a 1D environment.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:18.030
There's only one direction in which a car can meaningfully travel.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.250
Boats live in 2D.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.859
If you're on a lake and a boat comes your way,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.329
there's always a way around.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.570
The lake surface is much bigger than a highway.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.079
We will live in 3D because we can also go up and down.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.229
So in addition to being able to avoid obstacles left and right in all directions,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.359
we can also just go up and down.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.388
I hit my personal first 3D experience,

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.160
not in the air but underwater as a scuba diver.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.459
Many years ago, I took scuba diving lessons.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.829
What I discovered is you jump to your water,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.609
you get your body to be the same specific weight as water,

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.769
which means you're called neutrally buoyant,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.395
which means just float and then I just swim around in your space.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:01.935
You can control your depth basically by a breath.

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:03.120
The more you inhale,

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.000
the more floating becomes or buoyant you become and you go up,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090
and the you exhale, the more you go down.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.325
It's the coolest thing on earth to be able to fly,

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:13.775
you can literally fly underwater as a scuba diver.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:20.550
So now we're going to use the same principles for our drones and build our flying car.
