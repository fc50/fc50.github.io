00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
So, how do we actually use callbacks to execute a mission?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.790
Well, when we're executing a mission,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.920
it's important to realize that the vehicle actually

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.425
goes through a series of states or phases.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.750
And I'm going to use the word phase here because

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.050
the word state is pretty overloaded with other meanings in this context.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.395
And in general, there are many ways you can define your phases.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.510
For now, I'm going to stick with the phases used in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.360
that upanddown.py code that you just saw.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.700
First, there's this manual phase.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.005
And in this phase,

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.715
the vehicle's just sitting on the ground

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:33.055
and it's not being controlled by the Flight Controller.

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:36.595
This phase ends when the arming phase begins.

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.980
And this is just the phase where the flight computer

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.860
takes control of the drone, and gets the rotors spinning.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.915
This phase ends when the rotors are up to speed and the takeoff phase can begin.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:50.215
Now, takeoff involves the drone going straight up

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.010
and continuing straight up until it's reached its target height.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.165
At that point, takeoff ends and landing begins.

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.070
And landing, as you might expect,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.575
is just where the drone descends back to ground level.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:06.505
And it continues descending until it gets sufficiently close to the ground.

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.020
And once that happens,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.030
the disarming phase begins,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.815
which is just where computer control is disabled and the motors are disarmed.

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.610
Now to really understand how these phases work in our code,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.200
it's important to understand the transitions that occur from one state to another.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.905
And in the code, each of these transitions is actually handled by

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:32.170
a particular function with names like arming transition or take-off transition.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.450
So, the transition, for example,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.830
from the takeoff state to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.475
the landing state is handled by the landing transition function.

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:41.020
And in the previous video,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.850
you saw that there were certain criteria that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.460
had to be met in order for this transition to occur.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.095
Namely, the drones height had to be greater than 95 percent of its target height.

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:54.190
Now, I'd like you to look through the full code for the up and down flyer class

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.915
and try to identify the criteria under which each of these states ends.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:02.065
The real goal here is to really just read through the code and

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:06.265
understand how this relatively simple flight plan is actually implemented,

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.585
because once you've done that,

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.010
you'll be able to implement your own flight plan.
