00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Now it's time to tackle your first project.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm joined now by my colleague, Andy,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.960
who's here to help you get up and running. Pleasure to have you with us, Andy.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.150
Thank you, Nick. It is a pleasure to be here.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.405
In this project, you'll program a quadrotor to fly autonomously in a simulator.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:15.919
The central theme of this project is a new way of thinking

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.739
about how to write programs for autonomous vehicles.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.779
It's called event-driven programming,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.705
and you might have seen it before in other settings.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:27.214
Graphical user interfaces are written as event-driven programs,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:29.539
and lots of other robot systems are too.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.450
But there are some important wrinkles in writing programs for

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.050
autonomous vehicles that need to operate for a long time,

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.885
travel long distances, and respond to all kinds of things in the outside world.

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:42.230
When you finish this project,

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.839
you'll have the foundation you need to be set up

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.570
for success in the projects throughout the rest of the program.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.979
So where are we going to start next, Andy?

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.484
Well, if you're not familiar with event-driven programming,

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.299
it can be a bit confusing at first.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.179
So, we're going to start off by explaining the key concepts

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.375
behind this entirely new way of thinking about programming.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.549
Next, we're going to show you how to actually

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.594
implement event-driven programming in Python code.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:09.194
And that code will actually control your quadrotor in a simulator.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.504
But by far the best part is,

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.319
once you've actually completed the project,

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.829
we're going to show you how to put that code onto a real quadcopter.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.530
That sounds fantastic. Let's get started.
