00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.213
Now, before we continue,

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:03.700
I'd like to show you what the code you're

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.355
eventually going to write is actually going to do.

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:11.320
And here, I have a simulator window open and it's open next to a terminal.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.845
In the actual interface you use it might actually look a little bit different,

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.185
but as you can see,

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.899
when I do an LS here,

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:23.259
you can see I have this file called backyard_flyer.py,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.800
and that's the one you're going to complete at the end of this lesson.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.094
And this file actually has code which controls this drone.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:38.640
So let me just run that for you now without showing you what the actual code looks like.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.340
So if I hit Enter, you can see what happens.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.470
So the drone arms,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.134
and it takes off,

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:52.548
goes forward, turns right,

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:54.658
then it goes backwards,

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:56.548
and to complete square,

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:58.500
it slides to the left,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.350
stops in place, and lands.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.270
Now, this square path that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.020
this drone flew is not the interesting thing about this project,

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:08.670
though I do think it's pretty cool to see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.174
the drone actually flying in the square that I programmed.

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:14.340
What's interesting about this project is the code,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.810
and more specifically,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.799
the programming paradigm behind the code that allowed all of this to happen.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.480
And that is exactly what you're going to be learning in the rest of this lesson.
