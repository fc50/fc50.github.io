00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Welcome back. When you first get a new drone,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.669
you're going to want to bring it outside and get it flying.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.560
And in this lesson, which we're calling Backyard Flyer,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.345
you will simulate doing exactly that.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.020
Now, to simulate this experience,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.134
you're going to be working with the same simulator

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:17.304
you'll be using throughout this program.

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:19.545
The drone you'll be controlling in this simulator

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.870
can actually be controlled with Python code.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.865
And later, you'll be using C++ as well.

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:28.500
Now, the primary learning objective for this lesson is for you to understand at

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.204
a high level how this Python drone control code actually interacts with the simulator.

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:36.449
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.398
code in what's called an event-driven paradigm,

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:44.000
and that code will actually control a drone to fly in whatever flight path you choose.
