00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
If you've ever put your hand out the window while driving on a highway,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.509
you already have some idea for how control surfaces in a fixed-wing vehicle work.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.474
When you angle your hand upwards like this,

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:12.740
you can actually feel a force on your hand which pushes it upwards,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.000
and when you angle your hand downwards,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.579
you can feel a force which pushes it downwards.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.329
Fixed-wing aircraft is typically equipped with three primary types of

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.875
control surfaces called the ailerons, elevators, and rudder.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.750
These surfaces can be actuated by a pilot or an autopilot to control the roll,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.759
pitch, and yaw of the vehicle.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.890
If you look at our fixed wing simulator,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.359
you can get a sense for how these work and the vertical tail,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.375
you have the rudder and this controls the yaw of the vehicle.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.149
When the rudder is deflected to the left that introduces

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.939
a rotational moment on the vehicle that causes it to yaw to the left.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:52.579
The horizontal tail, you can see the elevators which control the pitch of the vehicle.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.754
When the elevators are deflected downwards,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.475
that causes the vehicle to pitch downwards as well.

00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:59.149
At the end of each wing,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.784
you can see the ailerons which control the roll of the vehicle.

00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:05.424
The ailerons act anti symmetrically,

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:08.000
which means that when one ailerons deflects upwards,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.765
the other deflects downwards.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:12.299
So, to create a positive role,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.384
positive around the body x-axis,

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:16.130
the ailerons on the right-wing deflects

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:19.405
downwards and the ailerons on the left-wing deflects upwards.

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.980
In addition to these primary control surfaces,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.454
some aircraft will have additional control surfaces like flaps,

00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:28.424
spoilers, slats, and rubrics.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:31.105
We're not going to discuss these too much in this module,

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:34.520
but you can read more about these additional control surfaces below.
