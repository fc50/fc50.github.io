00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Welcome back and congratulations on completing the first term of the Nanodegree program.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.355
Up until now, we've been focusing our attention on quadrotors.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.870
A quadrotor is what's known as a rotary wing aircraft.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.399
We call rotary wing because each of the propellers is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.399
actually a wing which spins to the air to generate lift.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.989
But as you know rotary wing vehicles aren't the only aircraft design,

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.848
there are also fixed-wing aircrafts,

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.184
like the one you see here.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:29.369
This is footage from the fixed wing simulation environment that you'll be using soon.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.850
As you can see, instead of using a motor to spin the blade,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.420
a fixed wing vehicle uses its own velocity through the air to generate lift.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.439
But there are other vehicle designs besides fixed-wing and rotary wing vehicles.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.500
For example, there are vehicles like Cora.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.579
Cora is made by Kitty Hawk and it's a hybrid fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.759
When we use the term flying car in this Nanodegree program,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:55.599
we're generally referring to a hybrid vehicle like this.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.789
A flying car like Cora has three important capabilities.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.990
First, it's capable of VTOL or vertical takeoff and landing.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.090
This means it can operate without needing a long runway to take off and land.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.799
Second, it's capable of both rotary wing flight and fixed wing flight,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.450
which comes with some benefits that we'll discuss shortly.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.320
Third, a flying car has to be able to operate autonomously.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.089
It's not practical or safe to ask everyone to become a pilot,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.510
so a realistic flying car needs to be able to fly itself.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.165
Implementing these three capabilities means solving

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.390
three main technical challenges on the software side.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.165
One, autonomous flight and rotor craft mode this is something you can already do.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.315
Two, autonomous flight in fixed wing mode.

00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:43.504
This is what you'll be learning about in the next few lessons.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:47.104
Three, how to transition from hover to fixed-wing flight.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:49.640
This transition period is a very difficult,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.959
and it's an open question on the best way to solve this problem.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.339
We'll be focusing most of this lesson

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.174
and the lessons that follow on the second challenge.

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:01.569
How can we make a fixed wing vehicle fly autonomously.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.189
But for now I'd like to talk a bit about some of

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.129
the many ways that people have tried to design hybrid vehicles.
