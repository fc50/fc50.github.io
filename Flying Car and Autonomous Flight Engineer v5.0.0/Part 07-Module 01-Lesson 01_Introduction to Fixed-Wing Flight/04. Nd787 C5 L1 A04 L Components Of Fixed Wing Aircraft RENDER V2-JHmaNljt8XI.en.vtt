00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.225
let's establish some basic vocabulary,

00:00:02.225 --> 00:00:04.859
so we can refer to the pieces of a fixed wing aircraft.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.380
When we worked with the quadrotor in term one,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.769
we didn't spend a lot of time talking about the various pieces of the quadrotor.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.109
It was enough to know that there were four rotors and we

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.574
can adjust the speed of each rotor to control the aircraft.

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:17.244
When it comes to fixed-wing aircraft,

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.740
there are a lot more mechanical pieces that affect

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.959
the dynamics and if you want to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.660
write an autopilot to make the aircraft follow a trajectory.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.140
It's important to know what these pieces are and what they do.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.414
So, let's take a look at a fixed wing aircraft.

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.280
The biggest part of most vehicles, is the fuselage.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.215
This is the main body of the aircraft.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.050
Next, are the wings.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.884
The wings have control surfaces in them,

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.854
such as ailerons and flaps.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:44.119
Any movable bidder the aircraft which changes

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.500
the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft is called a control surface,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.820
and we'll talk about these more in a little bit.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.280
Then you may have more control surfaces in the back.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.060
You may have a horizontal tail with elevators to control pitch,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.414
and you may have a vertical tail with a rudder for yaw stability.

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:04.000
The horizontal tail and the vertical tail together are called the empennage.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.129
Then we have our propulsion system.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:10.229
In this case, the propulsion system is a single propeller at the front of the vehicle.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.270
But you might also have multiple propellers,

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.354
in which case they would be on the wings.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.000
When we have a single propeller at the front of the vehicle,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.849
we call it attractor and when the propeller is in the back it's called the pusher.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.894
Finally, we have landing gear.

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:26.239
Since this vehicle isn't capable of vertical takeoff and landing,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.309
it needs wheels so it can roll along the ground.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.400
If this were an amphibious aircraft,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.300
then these might be pontoons or some combination of wheels and pontoons.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.219
There are many other pieces of a fixed wing aircraft,

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.069
but this is all we really need to know for now.
