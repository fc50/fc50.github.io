00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625
Before we jump into the details of fixed-wing dynamics and controls,

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:05.910
it's worth understanding the high level trade-offs

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.120
associated with fixed-wing versus rotary-wing aircraft design.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.799
The reason why flying cars do use a hybrid design is because they really need to.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.810
If you try to design a useful flying car with

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.210
a purely rotary-wing design or purely fixed-wing design,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.330
you'll pretty quickly see some problems that will be hard to deal with.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.099
We can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.175
each design by playing around in simulation.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.990
Here, you can see one obvious strength of rotary-wing aircraft vertical takeoff.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.105
Along with vertical takeoff and landing,

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:40.064
a rotary-wing aircraft is much easier to control than a fixed-wing vehicle.

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.320
Here you can see it hovering in place,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.924
which is something that a fixed-wing vehicle could never do.

00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:48.244
This is really nice for navigation, planning, and safety.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:52.669
The rotor craft have drawbacks for one thing they are very inefficient.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.700
Even hovering in place requires using a good deal

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.810
of power to keep the rotors turning and generating lift.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.365
This inefficiency drastically reduces the payload size,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:04.855
range, and flight time of rotor craft.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:08.850
Additionally, these vehicles tend to be pretty slow and quite noisy.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:13.204
Finally, these vehicles have little to no capability when they lose power.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:15.489
You can see that when I disarm the rotors,

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.399
bad things happen to the vehicle.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.619
That brings us to fixed-wing vehicles.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.079
One of the biggest drawbacks of fixed-wing flight is that

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.539
these vehicles need a long runway for takeoff.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.640
Once a fixed wing vehicle gets in the air,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.245
it has a lot of advantages though.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.630
First, you can see that this vehicle is

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.844
moving a lot faster than the quad-rotor ever could.

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:37.534
In addition to being faster,

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:41.030
these vehicles are also much more efficient than rotor craft.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.215
That's because instead of using a motor to spin its wings,

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:47.090
a fixed-wing vehicle uses its own motion through

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.204
the air to keep air flowing over the wing and generating lift.

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:55.295
This allows fixed-wing vehicles to carry much heavier payloads much longer distances.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.484
This approach to generating lift also has other benefits.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:01.790
For example, if the motor cuts out while you're flying,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.650
the vehicle doesn't fall out of the sky and in

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.640
fact you can still do quite a bit to control it.
