00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.380
Building an effective flying car requires using

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.339
a hybrid design that takes advantage of the strengths of each.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.560
Before you can design a hybrid vehicles,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.594
it's important to first understand how purely fixed-wing vehicles work.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:22.074
In this lesson, you were introduced to the various components of these vehicles.

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:25.609
In particular the wings and the various control surfaces.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.769
In the next lesson, you'll learn about lift and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.795
drag and how these aerodynamic forces influence fixed-wing flights.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.359
In later lessons, you'll learn more about the Physics

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.829
which govern fixed-wing vehicles and how you can

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.379
actually control a fixed-wing vehicle by issuing

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.200
commands to the propulsion system and the control surfaces.
