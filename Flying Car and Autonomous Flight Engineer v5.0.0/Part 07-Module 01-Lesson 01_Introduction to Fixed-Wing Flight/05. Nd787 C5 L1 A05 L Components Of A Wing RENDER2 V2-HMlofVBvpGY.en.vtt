00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
We've looked at the components of a fixed-wing vehicle overall,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.550
now, let's look more closely at the wing.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.634
The wing is where most of our lift comes from.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:10.169
So, we need to understand properties of the shape and

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.984
size of the wing to understand how much lift we are going to have.

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:14.855
When we discuss the shape of a wing,

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.765
we use words like platform, airfoil and camber.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.679
The platform of the wing refers to the entire horizontal shape of the wing.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.695
So, the platform is what we see when we look at the wing from above.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.539
If we look at the cross-sectional shape of the wing,

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.554
then we're looking at the airfoil.

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:35.325
The airfoil refers to a slice through the wing at a particular point.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.465
For a low speed ultralight aircraft,

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:42.670
the airfoil might look like this while the airfoil for an airliner might look like this.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.000
We can quantify the shape of the airfoil by its camber.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.409
The camber is essentially the curvature of

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.409
the upper surface of the wing relative to the bottom surface.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.559
So, this wing on the top has more camber than the weighing on the bottom.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.250
In addition to shape, we also want to discuss the size of a wing.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.320
The wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.060
the semi span is the distance from

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.000
the center of the aircraft to the tip of one of the wings.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.140
We typically use the letter B to represent wingspan and the letter S for semi span,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.864
which means that S is equal to B over two.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:19.464
The length from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge is called the chord.

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:23.990
The chord will usually vary in length as you travel along this semi span.

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.584
When the chord varies continuously,

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:28.484
it could be hard to do lift calculations.

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:31.879
So, we take an average which is known as the mean aerodynamic chord.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:35.679
We usually represent the mean aerodynamic chord as C bar.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.850
The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the semi span to the mean aerodynamic chord.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.679
So, short wide wing will have a small aspect ratio while a long skinny wing,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.515
will have a large aspect ratio.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:52.275
There are various pros and cons associated with large versus small aspect ratios.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:55.905
All of these terms become very important when you get into wing design.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:59.099
Wing design isn't something we're going to get into in this curriculum,

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.280
but it's still important to be familiar with these terms.
