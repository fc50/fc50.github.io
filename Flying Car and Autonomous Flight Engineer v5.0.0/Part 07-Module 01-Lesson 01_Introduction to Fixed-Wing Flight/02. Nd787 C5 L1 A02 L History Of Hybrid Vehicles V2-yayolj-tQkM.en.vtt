00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
In between pure rotary wing aircraft and

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.859
pure fixed-wing aircraft is a whole pile of

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.620
different hybrid aircraft that have the ability both to hover,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.640
that is, generate lift without forward motion and also fly forward

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.285
using fixed-wing surfaces to generate lift aerodynamically from the forward motion.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:21.839
The variation between these vehicles is almost always in how lift is generated in hover.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.859
Some so-called tilt-wing aircraft rotate their entire wing.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.875
But, this can be complicated and costly.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.409
Other aircraft like the V-22 Osprey are called tiltrotors.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.399
These vehicles keep their wings fixed in

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.679
a horizontal configuration and tilt only the rotors.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.704
The Fairchild FZ3 takes an interesting approach.

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.195
This vehicle can tilt two-thirds of its wing downward like a flap.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:49.189
This generates lift by redirecting the horizontal airflow from the propellers downwards.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.429
Other vehicles, like the Harrier Jump Jet,

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.109
have what's called vectored thrust,

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.005
which allows the engines to direct the thrust downwards instead of backwards.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.020
Other vehicles called tail-sitters take off and land in

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.120
a vertical configuration and then use

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.819
their control surfaces to pitch forward to go into aerodynamic flight.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.734
The F-35B takes yet another approach.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.939
It has a large fan in the center of

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.670
the vehicle which provides vertical thrust during take-off and landing.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.900
Despite all of these different approaches to hybrid vehicle design,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.625
only two hybrid vehicles are still in production,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.459
the F-35B and the V-22 Osprey.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.819
The Harrier is also still in operation,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.044
but hasn't been manufactured for several years.

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:30.799
The main problem with all of these aircraft is that

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.289
they can be very difficult to control in transition,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.340
that is, when they go from hover to aerodynamic flight and back again.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.305
We're not going to try to solve this transition problem in this module.

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:45.080
Instead, we're going to focus on autonomous fixed-wing flight.
